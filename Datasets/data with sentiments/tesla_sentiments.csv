0,Tesla,3.0,1,more than 5 years,"A unique company, but it’s hard to last more than a couple of years here.",27-04-17,Anonymous Employee,"Fremont, CA",0,-1,1,"Completely casual dress code

Flexibility to work from home when needed

Always interesting to work at the factory

If you look at the SEC filings, you can see that the top people are basically compensated the same as the other employees, which is a pleasant surprise.

Many “beautiful people” here (male and female). Lots of eye candy.

A lot of people complain about the pay, but they paid me more than my last company, where I had the same title

LGBT friendly

The product is cool, and really fun to drive

If you’re in the right department, you might be able to drive a Tesla somewhat regularly. If not, there is an ongoing contest where you can be randomly selected to take one home for a couple of nights

The company is still growing

There is room to move geographically within Service, since Tesla owns the Service Centers

Lots of “car guy” coworkers to keep conversations interesting

Benefits actually got better and cheaper every year from 2012-2015, and stayed similar after that. I guess this was due to the company growing and getting better group rates. Regardless, not many people can say that.

You’ll frequently come to work that day expecting to work on a certain project and end up on something totally different. This can be good and bad.

Starting hours are typically flexible, which is a really nice perk. Nobody is making sure you’re in your seat at a certain time.

Most employees are surprisingly responsive and friendly.

Very heavy email-based communication, and it mostly works quite well.

You get good at doing the best you can with the resources you have, rather than doing the best possible job. This isn’t necessarily a complaint, since it’s a valuable skill to have, but you should consider if you’re going to be okay in that kind of environment before applying.","Rare to be recognized, let alone thanked, for going above and beyond to accomplish something out of the ordinary. Once you've ""done the impossible"", it's just assumed that you can and will do it again and again from now on. 

Literally hundreds of people in one room, desks on top of each other, as many as possible in every little space. Companies claim that they’re being “modern” and “progressive” by not having offices and cubicles, but they’re just being cheap. Look at pictures of offices from the 1950’s. You’ll see the same hundreds of desks in a room.

Yearly raises are typically less than the cost of living

Work/life balance is mediocre at best

Smallish yearly bonuses in the form of golden handcuffs. RSUs that vest over 4 years, so you’ll wait a long time to benefit from them

Those who were hired before mid-2013 made a lot of money off stock options, but many of those people are leaving now that all of their options are used up. 

Revolving door. It’s hard to last more than a couple of years here. 

It’s always seemingly a few steps away from massive failure

Very few processes in place, so work is done extremely inefficiently

Very common to compose an email and see “This is no longer a valid Tesla address”

The entire Service organization shares one budget. I am scrimping to save $50 on software while a barely-related manager wastes literally tens of thousands of dollars a week on cool toys, and it all comes from the same place.

Everything’s urgent, and people try to name-drop that Elon’s watching this very project so I need to stop everything for them. Luckily those of us who have been around for a while see right through that charade.

Technically, no 401(k) match, though if you’re careful with the health benefits you choose, you can end up with some leftover that can be diverted into the 401(k).

Middle managers are very hit-and-miss. Many were promoted because a manager was needed and they were the only one who knew anything about the department. Much room for improvement here.

Minimal leadership training. No real employee development opportunities. The results are just as bad as you’d expect.

Massive inter-departmental struggles. Most of my problems can be traced to one power-hungry manager of a sister department. It only takes one person to ruin the work lives of many people. 

There are more meetings than I expected from this kind of company. Elon sent a great email about how wasteful meetings are, but people have fallen into old bad habits.

Completely ineffective HR department

Every department is grossly understaffed, just barely above the point of collapse. Nearly everyone has to work harder than they would if they were doing the same job at another company.

Anything that they can do in house, they’ll do, rather than outsourcing to a supplier. There are people who spend their whole careers deciding “make vs. buy”… no need for them here, it seems. This is corporate arrogance, and it reduces quality, wastes human resources, and slows time to market in many cases. A positive side effect is that more products are made here in California than would be if they were outsourced.

Inadequate parking

Note to hiring managers at other companies: Watch out if someone from Tesla has “Project Manager” on their title. Many of these people are just general office workers with no skills beyond harassing people via email.","I was debating whether I approve of the CEO or not. 

On the one hand, he occasionally sends these excellent emails about business philosophy and avoiding siloing, wasteful meetings, and that managers are there to support their employees, not the other way around. 10/10 on that! When he leads an all-hands meeting, he usually has interesting things to say, especially if you can get him free-form thinking out loud during a Q&A session.

On the other hand, he is a relentless micro-manager and singlehandedly derails production, reduces product quality, makes hundreds of people have to work much harder, and causes massive waste because he wants to see every little detail and change those details at literally the last minute. It’s grossly inefficient and is ruining the company bit by bit. 

My advice to management: The company would work much better if Elon was only an idea man, locked up safely in a room somewhere, with his hands completely off of operations.","Completely casual dress code

My advice is to hire managers who have the ability to lead people to success and manage people with empathy. It may even be beneficial to hire managers who have experience training people and care about the success of teams. Additionally, build a workplace culture that people are proud of and excited to be a part of with more flexibility.","#NAME?-VERY slow growth at the company

Stop promoting data labelers into management positions and hire people with management experience. Or if promoting from within, promote labelers who at bare minimum have an education in business management. The supervisors are vastly under qualified and routinely employ power tripping antics at the expense of the employees under them. It created an incredibly toxic work environment that left many scrambling for the exit or getting fired for unattainable performance goals. I quit after watching half of my coworkers submit a volunteer quit, getting fired, or taking medical leave from the sheer stress applied by management. It’s really sad, because the work itself was fulfilling and engaging. Management is ruining that department. They seem more interested in preserving their own egos than building out a solid FSD product. Elon needs to get this department in order if he ever wishes to see a full, stable release of FSD.","Engaging work

245,Tesla,1.0,1,less than 1 year,This Aint It Elon.,22-01-22,Data Analyst,"Buffalo, NY",-1,-1,-1,The name. That's about it.,"First and foremost, let's start with hiring. The hiring process is a joke. You do over the computer interviews and you have to do an assessment before being hired. The assessment is nothing like what you'd be doing once you actually get onto the floor. They make it look easy, when in all actual - every work flow is different and doesn't even touch the surface of what you were told to do for the hiring assessment.

Okay, now let's talk about once you're hired and your first few days.
You go in on the first day and you do paperwork, the usual. They go over their pay, pto, rules and regulations yada yada yada - honestly whatever, it's a joke and I'll get to that in a second. 

But, you get picked for a workflow. Depending on what flow you're in, you only get a certain amount of time to learn it, and even when you learn it - you don't really know it. Their training lacks big time, and they don't have the proper training skills to teach a bunch of people things, especially when people do learn differently from everyone else. There is no accommodation to there. Here's a powerpoint, be expected to know it in 5 days - and best believe you need to have a 100% FQA rate to even feel like you're learning. They make it impossible and the QA'ers (some of them) pick and chose what they want to score you on - it's not consistent. 

Your workflow can change at any time - and just when you become comfortable in one place - you have to start all over. They give you no notice that this is going to be happening, it's kind of just do it and if you don't like it, oh well.

The job is only hard because management makes it hard with their lack of training.

Even that, my biggest issue with the company overall is HR and management. They don't know what they're talking about half the time, and god forbid you professionally try and confront them on things, it's game over you put a target on your back. They don't follow procedures and policies from the handbook, especially when it comes to pto. You are told you get ___ amount of pto hours, ____ amount of sick time, and when you get there, all of a sudden the hours are less from what they told you. The time you accrue should be able to be used when you want within enough notices time, and the company does not honor that either. They pick and chose when they want to allow people to use their time.

Oh, don't have a death in your family - or god forbid your parent is put on life support. They don't care. They take all of your sick time - and if you don't have much it's well we have to write you up for this. There is no remorse for difficult times. But yet the company expects you to show up and give 100%? Yeah okay.

Advancement. They talk about it on your first day. Oh if you show that you wanna move up and you wanna go to lead or supervisor this is how you do it. Unfortunately, if you don't turn into one of their robots, you don't get to move up. Again, you put a target on your back if you even try to defend yourself. You speak up, stick up for yourself, and management shoots it down every chance they get. They don't listen to you.

You will go unheard of at this company. You won't be taken seriously. Your feelings and opinions won't matter. HR is a joke too, they don't care about anything except getting paid. They don't like you reaching out to them to ask ""HR questions"", instead, they tell you to follow up with management who ultimately doesn't have any answers for you.

Do yourself a favor and just don't. Find a different company. 
You will be just a number here. A number with no support.

Tesla could improve by studying company culture. Then create a sense of safety and belonging for factory workers, where they feel their concerns will be heard. 

I would ask Elon and other executives to read books like ""Leaders Eat Last,"" ""Good to Great,"" ""The Dream Manager,"" and ""Turn the Ship Around."" Then improve the company culture accordingly.

Tesla execs would say that the company is not a car company. Its mission statement is ""accelerating the world's transition into sustainable energy."" I asked my whole line what the mission statement is and 1 person knew. We built cars all day, so that is what we saw ourselves as doing. Hardly inspiring.

Tesla also had a bad habit of punishing the whole line instead of firing a few troublemakers. We were banned from listening to music for months because a few people couldn't stop looking at their phones. More than anything, this pissed me off, it made my days 12 hours of mind-numbing work.

Some of the lines in the factory had unsafe stairs and steps that would be dangerous if a fire or earthquake happened. Consider safety as well as efficiency, or you will be grilled by lawyers after a major emergency.

As for Elon, we feared him. He has a reputation for firing us lowly cogs in his machine. Elon's work ethic fell flat on us, too. He once said that you can't change the world by working 40 hours a week. That is easy for you to say, Elon, when you are self-actualized and working at a company you built. 

Your factory workers are working 12 hour days putting pieces of plastic together. They don't feel like they are changing the world or making it more sustainable; they are building cars. 

I would love to have an intellectual chat with Elon, but never as his employee.","- Decent pay, especially with overtime.

If you're good at sucking up and would rather focus on seducing your supervisors instead of bettering the company, get ready to open your legs. There is evidence where supervisors are sleeping with each other and benefiting from it, but HR turns a blind eye about it. If this seems to be the environment you thrive in, apply. You'll fit right in. 

We had a supervisor(a) who obtained evidence of other supervisors(b) committing nepotism. Once they tried to report it to HR, not only did HR do nothing, supervisor(b) altered supervisor(a)'s performance review and had her fired on the spot. 

Don't believe in their lie where they care about your suggestions on improvement. They accept your suggestions but don't bother to do anything about them.

They pre-select people for promotions based on favoritism rather than output/skill. They still go through the formality of letting anyone apply for the promotion, but time after time we see people who are not qualified for the position promoted. Upon further research we realize it's because of nepotism. Don't get me wrong, there are some wonderful people that are leads/supervisors but they are all planning on leaving. They were the only reason why I'm still in this company. After learning they are all leaving, I'll be leaving too. 

There is no flexibility in work hours. I do think being late is unprofessional and tacky BUT they do not offer flexibility in their clock out times. Let me explain. Work starts at 9am. You can clock in 5 minutes early or 5 min late (8:55-9:05am) and you won't get in trouble. You can be 30 minutes late but you'll have to make up the time. Anything after 30 minutes is a verbal warning/write up. This is reasonable. I 100% agree with this. BUT. You must clock out at 5:31pm on the dot. If you clock out 1 minute early (5:30pm), you're written up for leaving early. If you clock out 1 minute late (5:32pm), you're written up for committing unapproved Overtime. We're using UKG(Kronos) for our time cards. Mistakes happen! The website glitches all the time. Sometimes you clock out, but the input didn't go through and you'll be accused of not clocking out correctly and written up. The supervisors refuse to acknowledge this and say ""They are unable to adjust your timecard '' which is utter bs because they've adjusted my co-worker's timecard recently. Supervisors are salary and do not use UKG(Kronos) so they don't understand the glitches we experience. 

You can participate in a raffle to test drive their Model 3, but you're actually working for free and they are collecting data from you. The vehicles are disgusting and are not properly cleaned. This is 100% not the company's fault that people are disgusting but they can get the car deep cleaned monthly (at the very least). 

There are a LOT of people in the lead/supervisor position that absolutely do not deserve it. Not only are they oblivious about their team/workflow, they push you to do more while they sit around gossiping or walking around just to monitor you. They are thankless and are quick to punish people. They do not know how to motivate their teams, only know how to say ""your workflow is the unhealthiest"" when they increased our goals/numbers a few days ago before we had a chance to reach it. Beware of DT. If you know, you know. They don't know how to recognize people, they don't even know how to read their own stats and don't know how it works.

The pay is $22/hr (not a livable wage). Other competitors start at $35/hr with a better work environment and similar, probably even better, benefits. A LOT of people don't last more than 1 year. We had around 1000 people in California(Oct 2020), over half of those people quit (Nov 2021), NOT fired/laid off, and they are now hiring people in Buffalo, NY (cheaper labor). 

So many unnecessary meetings (even after Elon has an article and emailed us about not having these meetings). 

HR can't touch the AM/PM/Supervisors. If they slack off, hide their mistakes and blame others, they get away with it. 

If you're still interested after reading all this, be my guest to apply. This crowd is right for you. The interview process is a joke, the only requirements are to be a high school graduate and be able to navigate in a 3D environment. It helps if you have a great attention to detail. Bonus points if you're attractive (probably a guarantee job if you're a 10 according to society's standards even if you're a dunce. 

If you can last for long term, the RSU that vests after 4 years may be worth it? You will have to sacrifice your mental well being dealing with the toxic environment. But hey, we have 25 free sessions with Lyra (therapy).

If you just want Tesla on your resume, please apply. They accept ANYONE because everyone hates it here and quits in less than 1 year. 

Copied this from another review because this is 100% true:
Note to hiring managers at other companies: Watch out if someone from Tesla has “Project Manager” on their title. Many of these people are just general office workers with no skills beyond harassing people via email.","Walking around, acting like you own the place isn't helping the company grow. You are just a waste of money that could be used to give over achieving employees bonuses who are doing 2x more work than you and impacting the company for the better. 

Stop promoting people based off of nepotism and actually take a look at the work your employees do. Maybe you'll retain more people and change the work culture for the better. 

Fire or demote the upper management that are contributing nothing to the workflow. (Especially supervisors). There should be performance reviews given to leads and supervisors by their team so they can have some accountability. This will probably open their eyes to how people really think of them.","Good benefits (no 401k match)

HR can't touch the AM/PM/Supervisors. If they slack off, hide their mistakes and blame others, they get away with it. 

If you're still interested after reading all this, be my guest to apply. This crowd is right for you. The interview process is a joke, the only requirements are to be a high school graduate and be able to navigate in a 3D environment. It helps if you have a great attention to detail. Bonus points if you're attractive (probably a guarantee job if you're a 10 according to society's standards even if you're a dunce. 

If you can last for long term, the RSU that vests after 4 years may be worth it? You will have to sacrifice your mental well being dealing with the toxic environment. But hey, we have 25 free sessions with Lyra (therapy).

If you just want Tesla on your resume, please apply. They accept ANYONE because everyone hates it here and quits in less than 1 year.

– Chance to work on projects with high ambition that feels very impactful, which decreases the chance that employees will feel bored or useless very often.

– Many opportunities to work on high-end, large-scale manufacturing equipment, which are great for learning (even / especially if such equipment doesn't always work).

– Smart, talented, driven people for the most part, individuals were often a pleasure to work with and fun to be around.

– Great resume-builder and career opportunities, just because of the Tesla brand.

– Can be fun / entertaining / eye-opening to work at a company that's so often the center of attention.","– ""Working hard"" is valued more highly than ""working smart"", which cascades to many other problems. Demonstrating engineering progress itself is too often prioritized over developing scientific understanding. Clear hypotheses are seldom articulated before running experiments, frequently leading to inconclusive outcomes. Precision and nuance are often overlooked, and empirical knowledge / intuition / heuristics are relied on too heavily. Data is often undervalued, or analyzed improperly, or over-extrapolated and used to jump to improper conclusions. The desire for data to fit in with specific narratives (in the interest of hitting short-term goals) often overrides critical thinking in guiding decisions.

– Equipment/process/manufacturing design is done too hastily, preventing designs from being as robust as they could be. Sometimes relatively simple design considerations or constraints are overlooked due to a lack of oversight, planning, or coordination between teams. 

– Goal-setting done by higher-ups is too often done in an arbitrary and demotivating manner. Management often seems too focused on hitting production milestones that distract from other work to make manufacturing processes more robust and reliable, which makes everything more stressful and difficult in the long run.

– Employee onboarding and training is a mess overall. Information that is critical for new employees to learn is poorly compiled or communicated, resulting in confusion for weeks and months. This is made even more difficult because expectations about individual roles for jobs are also unclear—people don't have a good idea of what others do, or who to turn to for help with a specific task / advice.

– Poor work-life balance—employees are overworked, period. They're asked (or pressured) to work long hours or on weekends/holidays, often without additional compensation. Burnout is commonplace.

– Generally poor team organization, resulting in a lack of follow-through on suggestions for improvements in project management, action items, or work priorities, especially in collaborative efforts.","Focus much more on building foundational scientific knowledge over generating empirical knowledge that is difficult to apply whenever hardware, processes, or design constraints change.

Prioritize long-term problem-solving over short-term milestones or performing one-off demonstrations when setting and working toward individual, team, and company-wide goals.

Work-life balance should be a top priority to improve morale, minimize burnout, and enhance overall productivity—not to mention improve employee retention.

Trust the experts that you hire. Technicians know their tools better than anyone—don't look down on anyone just because they don't have an advanced degree. Engineers understand the limitations and capabilities of processes and equipment. Empower these people to make the best decisions about their work for themselves, rather than overriding their ideas with your own (often less-well-informed) opinions about how the factory should be run.","– Great company mission around sustainability.

Some of the team leads are also very good at their job and wonderful to work with. The above mentioned also relates to some of the Supervisors as well.

The medical, dental, and vision benefits are fantastic and the employee stock options are nice..... if you can afford them.

Tesla looks good on a resume","I was hired and told that there would be plenty of opportunities to move up. Guess what? There have been none. They also reel you in with a 7K stock equity that matures after 4 years. But personally, I'd probably be dead or find myself in a psych ward before I reach those 4 years.

I have talked to many people who are constantly looking for other jobs, trying to find a way out and lead a meaningful career. The dissatisfaction of so many employees is a huge red flag. Given how many studies show that happy employees with high morale are more productive, it is deeply unsettling that the higher-ups do not seem to care about this fact. You are nothing but a number. If feeling appreciated and valued is something you're looking for, you won't find it here.

This is not Google, Facebook, or Apple. There is no company culture. There are no shuttles to the office. There are no TVs, ping pong tables, or anything else that these other companies have to offer.

The pay is so low that it is hard to utilize the employee stock option plan unless you live with your parents and have absolutely no bills to pay.

The workflow is constantly changing. And the training always falls short. Sometimes I'm not sure if the team leads even know what's going on. They expect you to learn a hands-on workflow through a PowerPoint presentation. And then be able to deliver their radically high standards within a few weeks.","Be more organized. Appreciate your employees. Stop treating us like second-class citizens. Increase employee morale and happiness and you may find that the employees are more productive.

There are many bright and talented individuals throughout the company yet many including myself felt isolated and unsupported by the company. 

I ultimately left because of poor general management and a lack of performance based rewards (apart from hitting sales quotas) or recognition which could lead to promotion or growth into other areas in the company. 

This issue with a lack of recognition/opportunity, however, is somewhat inherent to the company's structure as my store manager was essentially the highest level employee that would see my work. The store manager unfortunately did not seem to have much of a voice in the company/ hierarchical chain and the impression left was that employees at the store level are tools to make sales and are otherwise overlooked as long as the stores reach their numbers.",Positive company mission.

I felt like they really believe in what they were doing, were motivated to work hard and more than full-time (by far, in many cases), and gave me energy with their work. The engineers were incredibly good and very well-rounded. The electrical and mechanical engineers I worked with knew a lot about the sourcing and manufacturing of their products, and were deeply involved alongside me in managing the overall programs. I recall them staying late, coming in early, working on weekends. 
The goodwill of the public and of many suppliers helped us a lot to pull off some miracles. Circuit boards built and shipped to us in a weekend when they would usually take a week or more. Rubber prototype parts printed overnight, etc. This was all impressive and precise. We were pulling off many miracles to build the M3 and get it out on time.","My projects at Tesla were under-resourced a bit as is customary for the company that's done so much with such a small team and relatively-small financial resources. This was a tough constraint, but one everyone faced. Time was very short, always.
There was little support for newer hires to get ramped up and onboarded into their teams, unless you were an intern. We lost a lot of good people for bad reasons, and because tensions could be high. Turnover affected my team, adjacent teams, and me, as I came in expecting a mentor and fellow TPM coworkers who had left before I started or left shortly after.","- At the time I worked at Tesla, the management structure was a bit top-heavy in some places, and we needed more engineers at the ""bottom"", so to speak. A lot of key production work was done by an army of Canadian interns, who worked hard but got paid overtime to do work that we probably needed more full-time people to do. 
- Some timelines cannot be compressed more than a certain amount. We had to pull off miracles but even then some timelines shifted, naturally. 
- We needed more support so as to not lose people. 
- We needed ore advancement opportunities and compensation etc. I think this is something that just comes with time and maturity, which makes sense. Tesla has a long way to go and it will be great to cheer it on!","My coworkers at Tesla were some of the most passionate people I have ever worked with. I felt like they really believe in what they were doing, were motivated to work hard and more than full-time (by far, in many cases), and gave me energy with their work. The engineers were incredibly good and very well-rounded. The electrical and mechanical engineers I worked with knew a lot about the sourcing and manufacturing of their products, and were deeply involved alongside me in managing the overall programs. I recall them staying late, coming in early, working on weekends.

The healthcare plans are unlike anything I've ever seen. Truthfully, the benefits are why a lot of people stay. If they ever change these benefits, there will probably be a huge exodus of people. Company culture is ok. Most managers are pretty flexible and treat you like adults. Plus, if you mention you're interested in something specific, your manager will try and help you grow and learn. I became an Excel boss thanks a great manager at Tesla. Pay was decent until they changed the performance structure.","Lots of stress and pressure. There is a lot of higher level management turnover (I couldn't even tell you how many director's I've been through) so things change constantly. For those of us who've been here a long time, we laugh any time a new director comes in and says lets change everything to this (which usually is an idea which has been tried multiple times and failed). Also, the biggest con for me is the layoffs, there is always a huge threat of layoffs... I've been here almost 6 years and its pretty consistent they do layoffs every 6-9 months. And then they decide we don't have enough people and hire for all the positions they just laid off at less money. So if you do join Tesla, please know that things will change constantly (I've worked in many areas and it's the same across all of them) and they can change by the minute. Also, be prepared for the performance structure to change and for it only to get more confusing. I've been through 3 or 4 performance structure changes and been denied raises a few times because of it (not because my performance was bad... my performance has always been great... I got denied raises because they only give each team so much $$). If your whole team is great, then one of you isn't getting a raise. Also, there's A LOT of stress. Since things change so often, you get comfortable with one process only to have to completely learn a new one. And if you don't learn it quickly, your performance gets dinged. Also, if you work here, make sure to put boundaries in early. Do NOT let them take advantage of you just because you want to prove yourself... Burnout is so real at Tesla and you have to take of yourself.","Keep the benefits or you'll lose A LOT of people.

HR is just for name, no power and useless, after giving honest opinion still nothing happens to manager because they are very close to higher manager
IT took over by Asian people only, they don’t let others to reach there place. No white people at all. White people brings culture in company but this never consider. 
Managers don’t do any technical work, actually they don’t know any technical thing. they are just there to check status.

You feel not only purposeful in the group effort to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy, but also cool being associated with such a technologically savvy and groundbreaking product that works well and is beloved by the masses.","The challenging work life balance makes this place a nightmare, especially for women with children. There was a certainly a pressure to be ""on-call"" at all hours of the day, especially in a remote environment. Most individuals had their personal phones converted to accept work emails so they could keep up after hours. The late-night emailing is cumbersome and burdensome for those with a family. Leaders often refer to the culture of Tesla as a meritocracy - which sounds like a good thing (the hardest working people get the biggest reward) however that culture comes with a double edged sword. This concept really only benefits people who are young and single and willing to work longer hours and constantly say yes. If you're a yes-man or an ""idea-man"" you will get promoted, even with no experience managing people. There is a huge amount of turnover in all departments. The turnover massively hurts team morale and work life balance suffers because of it. Typically if someone resigns, Tesla asks them to leave immediately without any reasonable time to help find a replacement, and a whole team takes over their work until they can hire someone. Since Tesla is frugal, they will often promote someone from a lower level and ask them to do both their current job and their bosses job, with not enough compensation and not enough training or experience to succeed. Hard-working and talented people managers have left this company in droves over the last few years because the pace is relentless, executive leadership will not take criticism or feedback and HR cannot solve problems fast enough.","Address the toxic work culture immediately. Stop the culture of late-night emailing and requests by asking managers to implement team boundaries and respect people when they're at home trying to spend time with family. Don't punish women when they can only work during business hours. Offer flexibility during the pandemic. If you promote someone without management experience TRAIN THEM...don't just offer up a short video about harassment. Anti-harassment training is the bare minimum you can do. You WILL continue to cannibalize and bleed honest and hardworking people until you bring in experienced moral leaders who will come in and change the status quo. In my 6 years at Tesla, I've only witnessed a few great managers and they leave too quickly to ever create meaningful change. Find a way to reward good managers and hold the inexperienced ones accountable by analyzing their turnover rates.","The mission is the reason people work here.

- Benefits are solid enough, some cool perks here and there including a discount on merch and a few other items
- Your fellow production associates are going to be some of your best friends and the people you confide in the most","- Parking is a colossal nightmare, there are efforts to clear things up and make people register their vehicles and have placards but in the meantime, it's just a complete wreck, expect to need to park in south lot and take the shuttle to the facility, unless you drive an EV where you can valet it
- If you're new, expect to get lost on the way to the line because they'll show you once but not give you any handy info on finding it again, they also won't tell you where the nearest bathrooms, cafe, or other important areas of the factory are because they don't care enough to tell you
- If you're lucky you'll get a solid group with a competent supervisor, if you are unlucky you'll get sent to a group with absolutely abysmal management with zero leadership. It was made clear from day one on that nobody cared about me no matter how hard I worked on the line, solid employees were fired over trivial things, poorer performing employees stuck around if they sucked up enough to supervisors and leads. My group got written up for the dumbest and most inconsequential reasons no matter how perfect we were up to the point of the incident occurring, and positive feedback was rarely given out to anybody. Leads walk around yelling at associates to do something when the line slows down even though the work is exhausting and the breaks are way too short. 
- I cannot stress this enough, days are 12 hours long, you get four 10 min breaks and one unpaid 30 min lunch, that's it. The job is exhausting, you are pretty much always on your feet, always lifting, moving, bending, reaching, and putting your body in stressful positions over and over again. Over time this is absolutely taxing and doing it multiple days in a row can totally exhaust you. There's not much that the company can do if you get hurt aside from send someone to check on where you are experiencing pain and offer advice and stretches, but more often than not it won't result in any long-term solution. Tesla encourages proper ergonomics and to not put yourself in a position to get hurt, but at times it's basically impossible to do that. 
- Break areas are fine for what they are, its hard to get access to a microwave no matter how many are within the area. Some associates will steal your food if you put them in the fridge. I had my backpack rifled through on one occasion. I recommend bringing a lock for your things.
- Bathrooms are unacceptably filthy, in disarray, and way too far from the line. This is the only job I worked where going to the bathroom was ever a problem. There are never enough people on the line to fill in for you while you take care of a basic human need. Leads and supervisors were always super rude about you needing to take care of business.
- If you are late or have to excuse yourself from your shift within 2 hours of your shift start you are basically screwed. Tesla does not take absences lightly nor do they want you being late at all, even if its just by a few minutes. It is very easy to get written up for not being on time and you can get yourself fired if you call out too often.
- ESPP and the income for a production associate are kind of oversold as a positive when its anything but that. Starting hourly pay is essentially poverty wage in the Bay Area and you only get overtime pay after 10 hours, not 8 hours like you would think. Because of the stock prices, it will take forever for ESPP to be a solid incentive.
- There really isn't much room to move up within general assembly, your ceiling is really becoming a supervisor after becoming a lead and there's basically a never ending logjam to get there. It also seems like Tesla drags their feet on hiring for internal roles and its hard to really stick out if nobody will stick up for you.","Your management in general assembly needs a complete overhaul. Your associates and leads put in the hard work, damage their bodies, go through emotional turmoil of long hours and physical pain only to get yelled at for the smallest mistakes and written up or fired over petty reasons. They are the heart and soul of the most recognizable product Tesla produces yet they are treated like garbage while supervisors sit around comfortably at a desk off the line and rarely if ever offer any kind of assistance and only jump on the line to yell at anyone making the smallest mistake. Morale is insanely low, nobody has any incentive to stay, talented people are leaving rapidly, meaning more new hires come in, existing employees and leads become overwhelmed trying to balance doing their jobs and training the new people in hopes that they'll stick around. The last batch of new hires my group had either quit after their first day, or only stuck around for a week. They knew it was a trainwreck from the moment they got there, and almost every new hire is going to continue to think the same unless something changes. Please review who you have in these management positions and consider only placing qualified and passionate people there that could care even the slightest amount about the people who truly put in the work everyday they come in.","- As an associate you do get 3 or 4 days off each week even as a full-time employee which gives you time to spend at home or with family

1709,Tesla,3.0,0,more than 3 years,"If you seek long-term career growth, keep looking...",2020-10-01,Anonymous Employee,"Fremont, CA",2,1,2,"- Insurance benefits (health, life, etc.) and stock compensation are highly competitive compared to other employers.
- Ability to make an impact is what keeps folks here. Everyone is excited for the mission and deeply engaged in Tesla's products.
- Tesla is a very dynamic place to be, where you can add value in a very concentrated amount of time.
- Tesla will give you the opportunity to work on something in which you are not an expert, as Tesla values soft skills vs. hard knowledge.","- Salary is at or slightly below average. Annual bonuses barely account for inflation. Equity grants are the main form of compensation. 
- Job insecurity is a constant. Over the three years I worked at Tesla, I witnessed about 6 rounds of layoffs. This has a negative impact on morale and everyone always has one foot out the door in preparation of being let go.
- Tesla does not value individual knowledge or expertise. Tesla is the only company I've worked at where it is acceptable to announce on a Wednesday that you are leaving the company and then be gone by Friday. There is no effort to transition knowledge or roles, leaving to inefficiencies and knowledge gaps. 
- High attrition due to constant layoffs creates an unstable environment in which management/senior leadership is constantly changing, strategy is changing and knowledge is lost. 
- Tesla is a VERY demanding company. There is almost an expectation for employees to avoid incurring expenses and therefore employees will often pay for business expenses out of pocket. You will be expected to work long hours and be flexible to do so especially at every end of quarter. Due to this level of demand, Tesla is not a supportive place for parents or those with significant personal demands. 
- Because everyone is overworked, it is difficult to get follow-through from other teams and constant follow-up is required.
- 80% of Tesla's workforce is under 35. While this creates many opportunities for those early in their career, there is often a lack of functional expertise and professional maturity. 
- Elon has final say on everything and will not be challenged by others, including his direct reports, for fear of losing their jobs.
- Due to constant attrition, people managers and leaders are regularly purged. This creates an environment in which employees are rewarded for being average performers for fear of being promoted and then eventually fired. Many people who have remained at Tesla in the long term (i.e. 7-10 years) have done so by flying under the radar and avoiding visibility, creating a perverse incentive for mediocrity. 
- Many departments are male dominated and have a ""bro"" culture, with few women at the Senior Manager level and above. There are few people of color at the Senior Manager level and above. There is a lack of diversity within leadership and a lack of effort to cultivate and retain a diverse pipeline of leadership talent. Diversity is not integrated into the company culture as demonstrated by the radio silence from senior leadership this year (aside from the sole Black executive). 
- Career growth is not well tracked or managed. There was a period of 1.5 years where no formal performance reviews (or salary increases) were conducted. Promotions and compensation are HIGHLY dependent on the manager. It is not uncommon for someone to be underpaid or not receive a promotion for years because a manager is more focused on managing their personal job security vs. advocating for the team.","- Show employees that you care about them through low-cost or no-cost initiatives. Tesla could get more out of its workforce if it put forth effort into employee engagement and retention.
- Create a culture in which leadership/managers are enabled to advocate for their people.
- Release retention information as well as diversity information. Put effort into creating an inclusive environment across all teams, as well as at the Senior Manager level and above.","- Insurance benefits (health, life, etc.) and stock compensation are highly competitive compared to other employers.
- Ability to make an impact is what keeps folks here. Everyone is excited for the mission and deeply engaged in Tesla's products.

- Tesla will give you the opportunity to work on something in which you are not an expert, as Tesla values soft skills vs. hard knowledge.- Salary is at or slightly below average. Annual bonuses barely account for inflation. Equity grants are the main form of compensation. 
- Job insecurity is a constant. Over the three years I worked at Tesla, I witnessed about 6 rounds of layoffs. This has a negative impact on morale and everyone always has one foot out the door in preparation of being let go.
- Tesla does not value individual knowledge or expertise. Tesla is the only company I've worked at where it is acceptable to announce on a Wednesday that you are leaving the company and then be gone by Friday. There is no effort to transition knowledge or roles, leaving to inefficiencies and knowledge gaps. 
- High attrition due to constant layoffs creates an unstable environment in which management/senior leadership is constantly changing, strategy is changing and knowledge is lost. 
- Tesla is a VERY demanding company. There is almost an expectation for employees to avoid incurring expenses and therefore employees will often pay for business expenses out of pocket. You will be expected to work long hours and be flexible to do so especially at every end of quarter. Due to this level of demand, Tesla is not a supportive place for parents or those with significant personal demands. 
- Because everyone is overworked, it is difficult to get follow-through from other teams and constant follow-up is required.
- 80% of Tesla's workforce is under 35. While this creates many opportunities for those early in their career, there is often a lack of functional expertise and professional maturity. 
- Elon has final say on everything and will not be challenged by others, including his direct reports, for fear of losing their jobs.
- Due to constant attrition, people managers and leaders are regularly purged. This creates an environment in which employees are rewarded for being average performers for fear of being promoted and then eventually fired. Many people who have remained at Tesla in the long term (i.e. 7-10 years) have done so by flying under the radar and avoiding visibility, creating a perverse incentive for mediocrity. 
- Many departments are male dominated and have a ""bro"" culture, with few women at the Senior Manager level and above. There are few people of color at the Senior Manager level and above. There is a lack of diversity within leadership and a lack of effort to cultivate and retain a diverse pipeline of leadership talent. Diversity is not integrated into the company culture as demonstrated by the radio silence from senior leadership this year (aside from the sole Black executive). 
- Career growth is not well tracked or managed. There was a period of 1.5 years where no formal performance reviews (or salary increases) were conducted. Promotions and compensation are HIGHLY dependent on the manager. It is not uncommon for someone to be underpaid or not receive a promotion for years because a manager is more focused on managing their personal job security vs. advocating for the team.",0.38,0.88

Unorganized. Unqualified. The management here is the absolute worst with little to no understanding of what it takes to run a warehouse or manage a team but yet they get promoted for being there for so long, coming from target, and taking credit for other people’s ideas and the hourly workers hard work, Oh and for gossiping, arts and crafts, keeping a circle of friends who are allowed to slack off as long as they provide information to get people fired and using fear of getting written out of a job as their only way of maintaining power. Constantly out of supplies to perform your basic job, and threatened and harassed any time you fall under their “expectations” without trying to help you. Little to no training or support except for the leads and the inventory guys who are always running and sweating to try and put out the dumpsterfires that the supervisor ignores as she sits on her desk talking with her friend all day long. The loading area is a death trap waiting to happen with no space to move and still expected to offload full trailers. The hours are brutal and they apparently can call overtime at any time and label it mandatory. HR is almost non existent and if you do happen to get someone to hear you it gets swept under the rug by the very same supervisors. Don’t buy in to the promise of a great car company or growing here,Tesla is great but the Pomona warehouse is an absolute joke.

My number one suggestion would be an in depth 360 View of the entire situation and listen to those on the front lines before making a decision to separate an employee. Often a company may lose those who are experienced, protective, and share the overall vision and mission of the company. Never promote individuals from one department to a leadership or judgment role of another department if they do not have experience doing the job of those they are in charge of judging the quality of. Most specifically, I would never promote a person from a documents team, who has never experience the challenges of assisting a customer on the telephone, into a role where they now judge the quality of those on the frontline answering the telephones. If you haven't experienced a specific task, a person really has no experience leading to a role judging the quality of that task. 

 Additionally, Ideas and employees shares with a coworker through personal communication or their personal goals or ideas, Should not become the property of a manager or management to profit from their personal life because they have access to listen to, view, or receive indirectly. Furthermore, ensure in individual is logged out of every application website or tool personally or for business on their company laptop before being separated from the company. 

 Integrity. And sure integrity is Paramount. Investigate situations where it may be lacking.
 Profit sharing, If an employee notices conceives or recognizes a new Avenue for the business that could potentially gain the business billions of dollars, share with that individual fairly for their contribution.

EXECUTIVE TEAM: Management and executive team are only focused on metrics and output. There is little regard for employee happiness or improvement. Very little upward mobility within certain regions of the sales organizations as most management hires come from outside Tesla. Executive team doesn't solicit feedback other than a company-wide annual survey. 

INFORMATION: Important information is often withheld from salespeople until the last minute which harms our relationships with our customers and loses all trust. Product and process updates are often revealed to the public before employees. 

COMPENSATION: All Owner Advisors (salespeople) are held to the same standards regardless of location. This creates enormous disparities in pay between salespeople based on luck (location and popularity), rather than effort or talent. Within the same role and region, some people make $200k+/year while others make $42k/year. On top of that, the lowest-performing Owner Advisors typically get fired each quarter. Compensation plans come from the top-down and are variable, non-negotiable, and often detrimental to our annual take-home pay.

There are only two reasons why people stay at Tesla:
 - They are lucky enough to be in a high volume location which makes them a lot of money
 - They care deeply about the mission and are willing to be treated poorly by the executive team to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy","Employees don't work for you, you work for them.

2160,Tesla,4.0,1,more than 3 years,Company moves faster than the Model S,2013-09-09,Test Engineer,"Fremont, CA",2,2,2,"I am a multi-disciplined test engineer. I have been with the company with quite some time and have worked across most engineering groups with the exception of the infotainment division.

- ISOs and RSUs. I entered prior to the stock hike. Company-provided options and RSU grants for achievement has been a big financial reward and will continue to be until full vesting. This is important and one of the top three reasons Tesla has me staying put with the company (see Cons below)
- Opportunities to learn. The company moves fast and because of that there has been a multitude of opportunities for me to interact across various technical groups. I have had the opportunity without any hindrances, due to my role, to gain a holistic understanding of the technology behind this vehicle. It's special to say the very least.
- Bright minds. Tesla has acquired top-talent in its early days (I cannot say the same now see below). the backbone of the company has been the engineers with the confidence and courage to tackle challenges no one else has ever attempted. Many other automotive companies have come to recognize that Tesla is a competitor and looming threat.
- Advancement. Up until recent months, Tesla did a fairly decent jobs at providing opportunities for advancement. This was in part due to its very loose structuring (leveling didn't officially happen until a few months ago...) and also in part because you truly were recognized for your experience, knowledge, and impact. If you were promoted from level 1 to level 2, you earned it, if you were promoted from level 1 to staff (level 4) you changed the approach for something crucial and you definitely earned it. You got what you earned, and even though recognition came slowly, I can't think of many companies that would have let someone jump from level 1 to level 4 regardless of the fact they were qualified just out of tradition.

Bottom line. Though I am still young in my career, in comparison to many other senior engineers at other companies, whether they are friends, family, or acquaintances, I know that in my time with Tesla, the experience and knowledge I have gained has been 2x to 3x greater than what they received in the same amount of time. It came at the expense of very hard and tediou work and deadlines. But I made it work out.","People interested in applying to Tesla now must be aware of several things. 

My comments are particularly applicable to engineers. As Tesla continues to grow to support all of its upcoming activities (read the news) one of its biggest challenges is management. It is very apparent that the culture to a degree is shifting from a ""start-up"" mentality to a very particular vision of what proper management should look like. This includes leveling, improving documentation, enforcing best-practices, etc. There is one very big drawback that anyone looking to join a cutting edge company should be wary of: this is slowly KILLING the original culture of doing what is necessary, thinking outside the box, promoting cross-group interaction. Elon won’t ever let this culture shift touch the side of innovation and technological advance thankfully. This I am certain of as it would kill the heart of Tesla's edge.

I have been fortunate enough in my career that I just made it onto the ""old Tesla' side of the team. This is a group of people who recognize there are management challenges and there is need to improve on those now, but also understand there is a need to minimize internal politics to remain one team. It is also a team of individuals that have leveraged and maintained a particular amount of political pull to keep that system in-line to a degree. Let me draw on one generic example. A large group discovered a flaw that was in part due to decisions made along with another group, and instead of approaching the problem with a “let’s fix this” attitude, they “strategically waited” until the other group confronted and accepted responsibility before acting towards resolution. This, in my mind, is unacceptable. 

What I have been witnessing in the transformation of the company is a greater dependence on politics. Be prepared if you are an associate level engineer to be told exactly what you are allowed to do. And if you are senior level, know that you are entering potentially shark-infested waters depending on what division you are working for. Ask as you apply and interview to learn more about the dynamics. 

The last downside is compensation. Tesla targets average pay, nothing less, nothing more, unless you are a rare candidate with such specific expertise that no one else like you exists. If you are that individual, you will be treated well (senior manager, exec, VP level). As a new hire, you do not have as much of an edge with your options. Your strike price will also be significantly higher than “older” Tesla colleagues. You will get paid enough to live on, but without the added bonus of ISOs at your side helping to ease the pain as you work tirelessly each and every day, you will find it more difficult to make it at Tesla. 

The company and used top talent and let them go off to other companies after they were burnt and ground to ashes. I’ve seen some of the best engineers leave under these circumstances. And as many other reviewers have mentioned, if you decide to take a job with this promising company, know you WILL sacrifice work-life balance, your family with see less of you, and you will have to make sacrifices while you stay at Tesla. You will get down and dirty. In return you will hopefully receive bonuses and rewards for your hard work and you can say you were part of it all, changing the mindset of all people, and shifting the paradigm and direction of personal-vehicle technology.","-Remove all personal ambition and pride as it tends to limit your team
-Remove road blocks through the implementation of management initiatives instead of creating them
-Encourage original thinking, cross-group collaboration, etc. to feed the minds of your top-talent Stanford/Berkeley/Waterloo/Michigan graduates to keep them engaged
-Recognize the work of your team members directly because it greatly improves morale

Unfortunately, hours kept getting cut for production employees, and we were regularly sent home without a full day of work; it was challenging to make enough money to make ends meet at the time.

Traffic leaving work is terrible, it may be a half hour before you can reach the main road. Some employees may road rage in the parking lot due to this. I’ve had items thrown at my vehicle for going when it was my turn.

I've found everyone I've interacted with to be competent and respectful. Teams are highly collaborative. My immediate manager is very reasonable and communicates expectations well. The technology itself is inspiring - EVs are the future of transportation. Free cereal and coffee.","Tesla has been experiencing a lot of growing pains with trying to accomplish too much, too fast. Poor processes and infrastructure result in wasted time and quality control issues at pretty much every area of the company, whether software, manufacturing, or customer service.

It's a large company, so roles are somewhat fairly narrowly defined. I learned a lot in the first six months, but then found myself wishing I could branch out more after a year. It's not easy to move around between engineering teams/roles.

Compensation can be poor (particularly for new hires with limited experience or straight from school). More senior roles within engineering do appear to be better-compensated, at least.

Infrastructure is poor for certain aspects of development and validation. Without dedicated teams for maintaining test infrastructure for individual firmware teams, things have fallen apart over the years and are not scalable/sustainable.","Elon's combative Twitter rants hurt the image of the company, push away potential employees, and embarrass the company as a whole. Tone it down.

Overly aggressive (if not downright disingenuous) timelines are never met and make the company look like it's perpetually behind schedule, even though the pace of progress has actually been reasonable. Be more realistic.

Ensure that teams have the time and resources necessary to maintain infrastructure so that they can remain efficient as scope increases in scale with new vehicles and variations. This particularly applies to firmware validation, which I fear is a ticking time bomb.","Tesla has a fun, challenging and fast-paced environment.

Terrible junior leadership. Tesla hired practically anyone for a supervisor position from 2016-2018. 
Now the middle management is composed of 25 yo's that are far too inexperienced to lead/manage 50+ people. I have seen supervisors cuss out workers, have relations with their Associates, come in half a day late multiple consecutive times and don't get a slap on the wrist, all while they make their 70k. 
I've also seen the same supervisors write up Associates for sitting down or checking their phone for ""Tesla Team Messages."" There's a no cell phone policy for production reason, but there's also the contradicting, ""check you're messages b/c I need you over here now!""
Now these ""write ups"" will bar promotions and internal movement for 6-12 months. 
While anecdotal stories very similar to this happen TIME and TIME again.. and the senior leadership wonders why there's such a terrible work culture.

There's many associates with mba's or are veterans, that have led teams far longer than the children that were put in jr management positions, that are trying to get there leg in the door. There's also a great cause with the company that would be motivating, however, its hugely undermined by JR leadership. 

It would be easy to say keep your head down and just do the grind till you can transfer, but when a supervisor writes an entire section up for one individual sitting down on a 12 hour shift.. things get out of hand.

They employ intimidation tactics and in a heartbeat, will offer your spot to someone else if there is an inch out of line or any sort of disagreement with the stringent terms they've offered. They know that they're in high demand and will use this to their advantage to make their interns and employees feel worthless. 

I am personally in a very difficult financial situation, being a scholarship-dependent student, and have had difficulties with acquiring affordable housing for my internship period. I have been told in the past that they do not provide housing for interns that attend universities in the area, albeit I know people from the area that have received housing compensation. I inquired again about housing compensation nonetheless and was met with an email scheduling a conference call with the recruiter and my manager with the overall threat of having my offer rescinded. There is zero room for dialogue.

Lots of opportunity. You can come into the company and work on something awesome from day 1, if you're lucky. Bad people have a way of getting fired. Come to think of it, any time I realized someone wasn't carrying their weight, within 6 months they were gone. That's a good thing. Coworkers are by and large pretty awesome. They might not be the most gifted or talented in all cases, but this is a place where people's hard work pays off. You always need to work about 3 times harder than you thought to make that a reality though. It's full of driven people. There are cracks in the foundation at every level, but somehow we push forward, and some details are not that important. If you can ignore those things, or like other people ignoring some details in favor of the big picture, it's great.","The company and culture will suck you dry. Your soulless exoskeleton will have a tough time finding another job while being pummeled to death by relentless demands. It's not coming from just one person, as a matrix organization it's more like death by a thousand cuts. The longer you work there, the more people in far off departments will remember you, and line up at your desk/email you and copy bosses demanding urgent actions. As a global company, this is 24/7 and sometimes in a language you can't read. In the beginning it's fun and very interesting. A great challenge. But everyone has a limit, and you will get there eventually.

In the early days everything is cool. You can start something new, build it up, make it awesome. Then support it forever, have more similar things dumped on you, and watch all the new flashy interns working on the cool stuff. Once you take something on, you can almost never escape it. If you get an intern, management expects you to give them the cool stuff and keep the garbage for yourself. It makes sense to continue the cycle of entrapment. 

Internal mobility is a joke, a way for management to pass off under-performing staff or people they don't get along with. If you do a good job, you are stuck, and your manager can stop you from moving anywhere else. You might need to quit and re-join to move within Tesla. So make sure you like the job if you accept it, forget getting your foot in the door and then shifting to something you like better.","Stop under-staffing everything, add a bit more management to triage work better, and not overload your senior staff until the point they leave. Give your staff some options once in a while to take on a new project and unload themselves of some things that have become a bit old. A fresh take can be a good thing that comes out of handing off a project. It can be neat for a new hire to take on something important, so spread that around. It probably makes sense at this stage to start thinking more than 6 months ahead, try to keep some of your engineers in a long term career path so they can imagine working their whole careers at Tesla. The company will keep doing awesome things, Elon will get personal credit for all of it, but having some joy of contributing to something that is new and awesome every few years would be beneficial.","Great mission, important for the world.

Lots of bright people, particularly in engineering where top talent is (at least temporarily) attracted to the flashy projects and given substantial (probably too much) freedom to deploy innovative designs in production.

Management's solution to their own incompetence is to work their employees harder, but this negative cycle is unsustainable. Many of the best employees leave and take their institutional knowledge with them. This exodus impacts production and management responds by making the new employees and those that stay work even harder still, driving more of the good employees out the door. You get the idea.

Operations management is young and inexperienced. There is no Tim Cook to match Elon's Steve Jobs act. Few managers have prior automotive industry experience. Many decisions are seat-of-the-pants and it shows in the numbers and workflow. Operations executive turnover is high as Elon has little patience when these ill-prepared managers do not produce quick results. As a result of turnover and general disorganization, org decisions (hiring, promotion, layoffs) are largely political, not driven by KPIs or performance.

Pay is well below market. Much of the compensation package is given as equity, but long gone are the days when the equity awards had upside potential. The stock price is sky high, and employees are likely to see their equity award's value shrink or remain flat over their vesting cycle.

Overall, employees are treated as expendable. Training opportunities are basically nonexistence. Promotion is political and extremely competitive (unless you worked with a manager at their previous company or came from Apple).

The few fringe perks once offered (free cereal and fruit, lunch vouchers for those who don't drive to work, and the occasional company party) have been almost entirely cut as a symbolic austerity gesture by finance.

With acquisition of Solar City, an already unfocused, disorganized operation now has a huge curveball to deal with. I am very concerned that this integration will be the death of the company.","Stop treating your employees, who are your most valuable resource, as expendable. Employee tenure is crazy short. Engagement is also low in many parts of the organization. Sure, you can probably hire smart, fresh faced kids to replace last year's crop, but the turnover and loss of institutional knowledge will slowly destroy the company.

Stop trying to do the cool thing and focus on execution. Not every process needs to be reinvented. Tesla does not need to make every single part in-house. Hone in on core competencies and drive operational efficiency. In short, make the company more boring. This probably means forcing Elon to stay out of technical decision making when he isn't properly equipped to contribute to the conversation. It also means ditching the Solar City acquisition, which is an unnecessary distraction at a time when the company just reported a big miss on production numbers.

Hire industry veterans, not wiz-kid tech talent, to run your operations organization. The company needs their deep experience and best practices. The young talent will still bring plenty of innovation to the table. And the mentoring will go a long way to improving middle management.

And as for middle management, take a good hard look at who you have promoted over the last 2 years. Some mistakes were made. Avoid these mistakes going forward by improving performance management and org decision making processes -- a case study of HR processes at Google would be a good place to start.

Elon, stop firing senior managers on a whim. Even when they are justifiable, these decisions have huge implications for morale and organization of entire departments. Too many changes are a distraction and obstacle to getting the meaningful work we all came to the company for done.","Meaningful goal to fight climate change. Compelling product. Strong brand.

They get five stars for building a stellar product, and +1 more for opportunity to innovate in the automotive space. (Yes, I know that's 6 but they lose 4 for crappy management).

The biggest plus for Tesla is that the CEO is willing to make mistakes and take risks. Tesla is also willing to incorporate relatively new technologies into their products. It is a company challenging the automotive industry to ""do better"" by setting a high bar for quality and features. This is worth involving yourself in, IMHO. So there are some excellent opportunities there.","The company's management and HR policies are awful (-4 stars for this). They sometimes promote managers from within, but engineers frequently have exceedingly poor people skills, at least they did at Tesla. To make matters worse, the HR policy uses ""stack ranking"" and each group is forced to pick one individual as ""worst"". These people, no matter how skilled, are culled once or twice a year. So if you are great at what you do, working with 4 other great people, one of you is going to get let go, doesn't matter if all are great. This is incredibly stupid! It creates an atmosphere of suspicion and non-cooperation, and psychological fear. Very bad.

The work place itself is low rent: IKEA tables and chairs. Big, open, very noisy space; poorly lit and visually distracting with people walking between long aisles of ""desks"". It is furnished like a start up, but is a multi-billion dollar publicly traded company. Its bad enough that they tended to avoid showing the work area to potential hires.

Tesla is a great place to ""come from"", but not a great place to be.","Tesla should get rid of their ""stack ranking"" policy and whomever supports such abusive measures.

Tesla should restore the breakfast cereal they took away from their R&D employees (this was a petty, vindictive move as there are no food services at or near the office, which is located away from any nearby eateries).

Tesla should generally get a clue when it comes to dealing with creative engineering people. There is no way they can retain great talent with the environment they've created, and now that the company's stock is so pricey, they have no way to attract people purely based on stock options. 

For an otherwise brilliant CEO, Tesla's treatment of people is a clear blind spot (or intentional? you decide).","Tesla attracted some really great individual contributors to build Model S.

Supervisors and managers Don’t know what they are doing","Stop lying and be honest. For 1 year I held a position as a training coordinator and didn’t get paid for it at all. I received 100’s of promises and smiles in my face but no action to get me paid. After all the failed promises, they laid me off saying I have no experience. If I had no experience in training they should not have kept me in the training position for over a year to train over 6,000 associates. I created multiple work instructions, standard work, and build processss, I even created a slide show that is shown everyday in the training room for everyone to view. If I have no experience, everything I created should be removed or remodified, because it is not up to par to Teslas mission. What doesn’t make since is on all my reviews I never received anything under a 4. If I did have low performance upermanagment should have moved me out of the training team, because I trained over 6,000 associates. These associates are building cars humans drive! If I have no experience for the year I was in the training department I advise all associates be retrained to the correct Tesla standard.","Benefits

It feels like a startup where you're directly contributing to changing the world but is big enough and has enough money to treat their employees well. By no means is it like working at Facebook or Twitter (there are little to no perks beyond pay and brand name) but it does make you proud of what you are doing with your life while you are there. This is something that is extremely rare to find anywhere else. People work here because they WANT to work here not because they want to get rich.

On that note... the pay for hard working Owner Advisors is VERY good. I watched the sales organization revamp at least 10 times to what it is today and I can honestly say it is a world class paying sales organization for the product it sells. 

With time the company will be a much better place to work.

Power struggles and inexperience run rampant. This is currently being fixed as poor managers with too much power are being demoted or moved. 

Competition within sales used to be playful and inspiring but now is a determent from being able to do your job well. It's an awful culture within sales. It really has turned in to a huge cat fighting mess. Great culture and attitude within the overall company though and a focus on ""the mission"".

There is also virtually no room to grow within the sales organization. Once you are an Owner Advisor, there is nowhere else to go. Become a Store Manager? Make less money in commission. After awhile you loose the will to stay on the grind. 

P.S. time off in sales is strongly and silently discouraged.","Train and recognize great managers and enable them to help your low level rock star sales people rise through the ranks. If they're not doing the right thing... HELP THEM GROW... don't just talk bad about them behind their back to other employees and managers. Growing your employees is what being a manager of people is all about.

The company's work really is helping to change the world (at least through the inspiration of competing electric cars).","Poor leadership (see the ""Advice to Management"") section. 

The organization is very hierarchical and I far more often heard arguments than cooperative conversations.

It's a very high-pressure environment, so don't expect an exceptional work/life balance.

Everyone seems to think that they can get hired as an associate or technician and work their way up to some highly advanced position. You need to understand that it's not a startup anymore. There are fixed roles in the organization, and an enthusiasm about cars doesn't qualify you to be an engineer in the company's eyes. (No, I wasn't one of the people who thought this way, but I met enough of them that I thought it was worth noting.)","(This is all of course, speaking from experience in one segment of the company, but I'd say this is food for thought.)

The primary means of getting things done doesn't appear to be problem solving but, rather, applying pressure to the people beneath you. This gets carried to such an extreme that often the emphasis gets shifted from giving actual results to giving the APPEARANCE of results to satisfy your superiors. I've seen this happen at all levels and I earnestly think it's a ""trickle down"" effect, judging from what I hear from those higher up. This of course can lead to poor results in the long term, but few people are so noble as to jeopardize their jobs in the short term for the long term good of the company. Rather than simply making demands, I recommend starting conversations about the difficulties and requirements of a process and try to problem solve with people.

Instructions are often handed down as absolutes, typically without explanation or any room for feedback. This is unfortunate, since the individuals closer to the processes in question often have useful insights. If you keep people out of the loop on the grounds that ""you're in charge,"" you miss out on relevant information and have fewer eyes and minds on the problem at hand. Perhaps, before the time comes to make a decision, when you've first noticed a potential problem, talk to the people involved and get their feedback, even if the people are only technicians or associates. If you explain why decisions were made they were, this helps on multiple levels too. For starters, it helps with motivation, because people don't feel like they're being arbitrarily ordered around. Additionally, if people understand the actual goals behind the instructions they're given, it allows them greater versatility and thoroughness in serving that goal. In other words: they can serve the principle of the law, not just the letter.

Rumors abound about individuals who made a mistake and were fired on the spot for it. Whether or not these stories are true, it engenders a culture of fear among employees. This doesn't result in an absence of mistakes (which is impossible), but rather, mistakes are denied and covered up. In this situation, mistakes are slower to be identified (if they're identified at all), slower to be corrected (if at all), and there's less opportunity for learning on the part of individuals and the institution. Try to encourage an open environment that allows people to come forward without so much fear or reprisals. (To paraphrase Deming: ""What, are you going to fire every person who makes mistakes and hire only people who don't make mistakes?"") I know there's lip service to an open environment, but having the CEO's email address doesn't count for much if you receive semi-threatening orders from your superiors NOT to email Elon about something, nor do people necessarily feel comfortable giving earnest feedback to senior management when you hear things like ""People who don't tell Elon what he wants to hear don't last long.""","It looks good on your resume.

Tesla is a great stepping stone, but not somewhere to drop your roots. 

I grew a lot here and was able to springboard into another great company where I am much happier.","Middle management is full of two faced liars just trying to get themselves ahead. I have numerous anecdotes with evidence where managers, directors, and even executives have blatantly lied and made terrible decisions causing irreparable harm to moral and strategic direction. Unfortunately, this is normal at Tesla and working there for an extended period of time will cause anyone with half a heart a great deal of frustration and stress. 

Work life balance... None. This is nothing new, but trust me it is an unsustainable place to work for a long period of time. Those who have endured many years there have sacrificed a great deal in their lives without a doubt. PTO is average at best and has to be used if you are sick. 

Pay can be good if you are n the right role. Your best bet is to be at the high end of the hourly scale since everyone works tons of overtime and you might as well get paid for it. 

Food options are not good, there is catering you have to pay for, and it's tasty but it's about 7-11$ per plate which is crazy since many workers there make less than $20 an hour. 

Overall it is largely a toxic place to work. Many tough 
personalities to work with and a culture of dog eat dog driven right from the top. You are replaceable, and you are disposable.

Tesla needs to treat people like people and not like disposable slaves.

Iots of opportunity and are only limited by your own drive. The product is amazing and it's fun to be part of something globally admired. 

Tesla is a great stepping stone, but not somewhere to drop your roots. 

I grew a lot here and was able to springboard into another great company where I am much happier.Middle management is full of two faced liars just trying to get themselves ahead. I have numerous anecdotes with evidence where managers, directors, and even executives have blatantly lied and made terrible decisions causing irreparable harm to moral and strategic direction. Unfortunately, this is normal at Tesla and working there for an extended period of time will cause anyone with half a heart a great deal of frustration and stress. 

Work life balance... None. This is nothing new, but trust me it is an unsustainable place to work for a long period of time. Those who have endured many years there have sacrificed a great deal in their lives without a doubt. PTO is average at best and has to be used if you are sick. 

Pay can be good if you are n the right role. Your best bet is to be at the high end of the hourly scale since everyone works tons of overtime and you might as well get paid for it. 

Food options are not good, there is catering you have to pay for, and it's tasty but it's about 7-11$ per plate which is crazy since many workers there make less than $20 an hour. 

Overall it is largely a toxic place to work. Many tough 
personalities to work with and a culture of dog eat dog driven right from the top. You are replaceable, and you are disposable. In my opinion Tesla has already burned through lots of top talent that will limit their full potential.",-0.17,0.98

Remember, Tesla is a young and innovative company but that also means it has many frustrating growth pains. For example: Managers that are unqualified and generally immature, but they've been around the company for a few years so they act like Tesla Gods. This made getting time off difficult, because the inexperienced sales managers looked at it as a lack of work ethic that would damage sales instead of a normal human need. Their immaturity also showed when they are confronted with new sales ideas. These were met with suspicion or general disinterest as if they already knew everything possible about automotive sales, a task the organization is absurdly new to. 

There was also a lack of organized career paths to move up interdepartmentally or change departments from, for example, sales to engineering or marketing. There were promises of growth first from the recruiters and later the sales managers, but to no avail. Managers moved around so much that the benchmark to gain promotion moved just as frequently, so you're left tossing in the waves.

Highly encourage young, smart people going to university and looking for a part-time job to apply, esp if you are an engineer or environmental science major. Great opportunity! Tips: If you interview, look clean-cut, wear glasses if you need them (majority of my co-workers wear glasses) and have a square, corporate vibe about you like a pressed, white collared shirt. Plus, speak very intellectually, articulately and with enthusiasm. The super corporate nerd is loved here!","-Transitioning to become super corporate
-The part-time job will be expected to be your number one priority
-Corporate/district managers see you as a easily replaceable, systematic number.
-Moving up the corporate ladder is very tight (expect to put in one year of part time before being considered for a full time position).

When I first got hired, Tesla had more of a start-up company vibe to it. Things are rapidly becoming super corporate and the way things are run, seems very systematic and machine-like. Before, it was more about overall customer experience. Now, it's be efficient, get their info, pass on the lead to make a sale. 

Also, if you want to become full-time at Tesla, be aware that you start part-time 30hrs a week at $13/hr, no commission, for about a year before you will be considered for a promotion, even if your work performance is solid. Salary for a full-timer in sales is about $40,000 annually. Commission is $60-$70 for every car you sell. This is factual information. Yes, I do find it a bit strange that you get $60 dollars for every $100,000 car you sell, BUT on the bright side, you still get your $40,000. (Note: Sales and delivery positions count for 90-95% of the company's jobs)

Recently, they have been increasing entry-level position, part-time workers and decreasing the number of full-time workers because from a corporate standpoint, you do not have to pay healthcare, benefits, etc., less money to be put out. The goal is to have more part-time workers to do a full-time worker jobs for less benefits and less company expenses for the benefit of the corporation, as well as top shareholders. I think this model is a fantastic idea to follow if you own a big corporation. If I ever own a corporation, I want to follow this example to increase my wealth. Very smart idea!

Tesla Motors, though, is a good company, esp with the technology and innovative machines they are creating. I really hope they strive to help mother earth in 2-3 years with their $30,000-$50,000 vehicle to positively preserve the environment for the better of the every man. Realistically, how it's going, I think it'll be more towards the $40,000-$50,000 range vs. $30,000 because it has to make company profit.

Overall though, I hope that Tesla can positively impact the world and really help people in polluted cities and make the world a healthier and happier place to live in (while keeping it at an affordable price for the majority of people to buy for the sake of the environment)!",Employees are not just a number in the system.

Salary for a full-timer in sales is about $40,000 annually. Commission is $60-$70 for every car you sell. This is factual information. Yes, I do find it a bit strange that you get $60 dollars for every $100,000 car you sell, BUT on the bright side, you still get your $40,000. (Note: Sales and delivery positions count for 90-95% of the company's jobs)

Recently, they have been increasing entry-level position, part-time workers and decreasing the number of full-time workers because from a corporate standpoint, you do not have to pay healthcare, benefits, etc., less money to be put out. The goal is to have more part-time workers to do a full-time worker jobs for less benefits and less company expenses for the benefit of the corporation, as well as top shareholders. I think this model is a fantastic idea to follow if you own a big corporation. If I ever own a corporation, I want to follow this example to increase my wealth. Very smart idea!

Tesla Motors, though, is a good company, esp with the technology and innovative machines they are creating. I really hope they strive to help mother earth in 2-3 years with their $30,000-$50,000 vehicle to positively preserve the environment for the better of the every man. Realistically, how it's going, I think it'll be more towards the $40,000-$50,000 range vs. $30,000 because it has to make company profit.

Overall though, I hope that Tesla can positively impact the world and really help people in polluted cities and make the world a healthier and happier place to live in (while keeping it at an affordable price for the majority of people to buy for the sake of the environment)!",0.1,1.0

Mandatory Saturdays. You would think that they would have more than enough help, but that is not the case.

On top of the already 50+ hour work week, you don't usually get but 5 days off per month.

Speaking of PTO, there are no sick days or sick pay in this company.That too, comes out of your PTO balance.

There are multiple issues with team in terms of team projects, work responsibility distribution, internal team politics and appreciation of one's intellectual skill-set or talent.

The team's objective is to run trials of different battery and invertor parts and introduce them into manufacturing. There are issues with team's co-ordination where they have to source parts from different suppliers and co-ordinate with quality, manufacturing and process teams to run the trials. The team is not good at proper co-ordination between cross functional team issues and struggles to meet its deadlines.

The team hires graduate college interns non technical/ non skilled works like printing labels, posters and stuff which definitely does not add to there technical knowledge. Any request for good technical projects tends to labeling the people as poor performance ratings. Interns are often used as scapegoats for failed milestones.

I heard someone put it quite well ""Tesla is a great company to come from, but not a great company to be in"". Any job you take after this will feel like a vacation.

* Co-workers are great","*This position seems to be suddenly expanding in the last few months as end of quarter production is pushed. Because of this, there are definite growing pains and it seems very little guidance has been given to management about how to handle the sudden influx of new hires. The job was listed as full-time when I applied and upon arrival at the ""hiring event"" for a group interview, the job candidates were informed it was only part-time. This was very disappointing. There is a lot of uncertainty as to whether any hours will be available after the first of the year.

*I was told yesterday it is my job to make sure to hide problems from customers when they are scheduled for delivery. Because of this, we often have to turn down the lights in the delivery room so that people won't see scratches on their cars. For such expensive, ""luxurious"" cars the paint quality is sorely lacking.

*There is currently no 401k match. Because pay in the stores is not great, employees cannot afford to get Teslas of their own. Lack of knowledge about the cars is prevalent among employees because they don't drive them regularly. (You can't afford to buy a $60k car when you are paid $16/hr.)

*Onboarding/training is very focused on ""Ra! Ra! Yeah, Tesla! Our CEO is amazing! We are changing the planet!"" and not very focused on learning about the vehicles, how to present them to customers, and properly managing/executing paperwork. I have been working for this company for a month now and I still feel lost every time I come in for a shift.","* Plan ahead. I'm afraid it is rather unfair to hire six part-time staff at once and then not know if you will need them in a month. If it is a seasonal/quarterly position, set that expectation from the beginning. And if it is a part-time position, say so in the job posting. I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I was to learn the full-time job I applied for was only for a part-time role. (And yes, because of this I am actively looking for other full-time opportunities.)

* Take a hard look at the training program. You are wasting a lot of money! I don't need to sit in front of a computer for 3 hours/day, everyday my first week to hear about how amazing the company is. Also, it is hard to have focused training for your employees when you have over 100 people on a ""training"" teleconference who are going to be working in 3-4 different roles. Why are you paying me to learn how to be a CES? That's not what I was hired for.","* I appreciate the mission of the company and what they are trying to accomplish

Shift Leads and Production Supervisors recommend working overtime, which you can sign up for or be assigned one or two days more a month. Most associates work 5 to 6 days a week voluntarily. Based on the $17/hr for regular work days, and 1.5x$17 for OT, at 5 days a week or 3 days OT/2 weeks, you would make ($17*11.5*7 + $17*11.5*1.5*3)*2 = $4.496 K/mo which is about $53,958/yr. If you worked 6 days a week, about $68,034/yr. At 7 days/week, about $82,110/yr. These numbers will increase as your salary increases for $17/hr up to $20/hr. 
The primary reason folks work OT is to work in different parts of the Gigafactory. If you just work your mandatory shift, it's likely that you won't learn much as shift leads tend to be slow in training newcomers on different parts of a station while production supervisors move associates around to let them accumulate different kinds of work experience.","The biggest problem is the work environment. This is not a job for anyone who has respiratory conditions or isn't healthy. The chemicals in the air are highly toxic, more so on Panasonic's side. So definitely understand that every hour you spend in the factory is hurting your body. Some develop rashes pretty quickly and others develop or further existing respiratory conditions. Also, if you are not an athlete or had former combat training both within the last year on a regular basis, this won't be a good fit. As an associate, you stand on your feet 11 hours a day while frequently squatting down, applying pressure through the wrists, using your legs as a pump, and pushing things while squatting down. I wasn't here for long, so I can't say for sure, but it seems that moving up is difficult, so I'd recommend folks to look elsewhere unless this seems like a good fit for you. 
From what I've heard, it takes a couple of months to keep moving up for the lucky few, and at least a year or within 2 years for the slower talents, both who work OT. 
One thing to consider would be joining Panasonic first as an operator or material handler. In this role, you would learn what goes into a battery cell and how to use the machines that make them. The benefits include 90% education fee coverage after you work with them for a year. The starting salary is lower than Tesla, but I've heard the culture might be better. Do understand that Japanese companies in general work longer with gaps from specified breaks. This means that if you had a break at 12 pm, you might not get it.","Instead of hiring more associates, train the ones you have on different parts of the line. Shifting workers around after they grow experienced on a line is detrimental to the smoothness a station could have had. Also when associates are late due to the shuttle, although it's 'okay' if we send an e-mail to the Production Supervisor or call before an hour our shift starts, it's not really settled. You will want to learn how to use snow chains so you are not ever late due to weather conditions that slow down the shuttle. You will also need to leave at least 1 and a half hours earlier than when your shift starts if there's snow on the road, as accidents will increase the typical 30 minute drive from Reno / Sparks to the Gigafactory. Even on a typical day, you will want to be at the Gigafactory at least 15 minutes before your shift starts so you can find parking and prepare to start work.","A lot of opportunities to learn manufacturing.

There are a lot of smart and caring people here that I enjoy working with. The engineering of the products we support is fantastic. The wages are competitive, the medical benefits are great and inexpensive to us. Time off is generous. And there's free Powerade!","Unfortunately, for the people like me who deal with customers one-on-one, our experience since the launch of the Model 3 has been very difficult. --But let me speak for myself. My role as a support rep is to resolve what I can but otherwise route the customer's issue to the person who can resolve it. Alas: more often than not, I can't reach the customer's delivery person or service center or what have you right away, while I am dealing with the customer, because those groups are busy, like I am. Under what I think of as normal circumstances, I would follow up on the issue and get back to the customer. But I can't.

Why? The company has cut back on staffing at our call center over the last 6-7 months, from 400 reps to 200. We are *always* in queue for calls. Customers wait on hold for anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes--or longer on bad days.

Given this, our supervisors have been unable to give us time to follow up, whether making outbound calls or answering email correspondence. (Super-reps maybe can do a lot of this during Wrap, but most of us are not super-reps, and all of us are drained from dealing with legitimately upset customers.)

Given all of this, we can't follow up unless we want to trash our metrics. And this being a call center, trashing our metrics means write-ups and no chance for pay raises or promotions.

The result is a really difficult situation for us reps to want to resolve a customer's issue, and for the customers themselves.","I think that upper management is engineering-focused rather than service-focused. This has allowed them to create great products that look to help fix the problems we face today.

It may be that such an engineering mindset believes that, well, if there is a need for service, it can be met through software updates, directions posted on the website, owners manuals, or, if push comes to shove, through online chat.

Maybe they're right. They certainly are more successful materially than I've been. But I've dealt with a lot of people, and the great majority of them prefer a different service experience. I think that poor customer service can be the death of a company. People talk to each other, and to other potential customers. A good reputation is gold, and a bad reputation is lead. It's hard to turn lead back into gold.","I've worked at the support call center in Salt Lake City for a year and a half. There are a lot of smart and caring people here that I enjoy working with.

2) Benefits: very competitive, sans 401k match.

3) Remains quite innovative, nimble, fast paced and open with communication. There’s a con to that too, considering the size of the organization, see below.","1) Compensation – not competitive in the Bay Area, tough to afford living there on Tesla salary. The once atmospheric rise of stock doesn’t cut it anymore to make up the difference.

2) Work/life balance. What balance? Time off on weekends or on vacations is a misnomer, requiring one to catch up while away so you aren’t hopelessly behind when you return. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but only if you’re not listening. They create work-a-holics by tasking you 30 hrs over what you can physically accomplish every week. Manufacturing lines shooting out emails, calls, etc. at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am is common and the production side expectation of covering all hours of line operation is absolutely ridiculous and responsibilities need to be delegated/divided.

3) Poor management. The issue is that a majority of people love Tesla because they think they’ll get to work on cool product & interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop sustainable systems & emotional intelligence. People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they spoon feed high priority info upward, making their visibility they output of their work. So there are layers of non-value add individuals who are horrible managers and leaders. Yet, there is no system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""sustainable systems"" are not taken seriously.

4) Schmucks, the fast paced environment in combination with the spoon feeding middle management results in a toxic atmosphere, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience. Many managers straight-up intimidate/scare their employees into compliance of doing exactly what they want them to at that exact time (extreme micromanagement), without even understanding the priorities that person has (resulting in no-win situations and poor performance overall). This intimidation is a blue collar management tactic that doesn’t work on highly trained, highly intelligent engineers.

5) It's a big company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy. So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.","1) Embrace emotional intelligence and a sustainable work environment. Getting a great engineer (from other areas/disciplines) to cover busy work in production, knowing they’ll get sick of wasting their time on logistics and tired of constant reactive firefighting is not only unsustainable, it is unethical. You need great managers and leaders in order to build the right system(s) and become a great success. Throwing more bodies at a system that isn’t setup for success is the wrong way to succeed on many levels and will result in inefficiencies, not competitive advantages.

2) Do something about that work-life balance. Leaderships answer to solving reactive problems can’t be to ALSO add in the proactive work... there isn’t enough time in one person’s day to cover both when firefighting is happening most of the time. Consider re-evaluating how work is done; what processes are in place that are inefficient and ineffective and need to be updated or removed?

3) A flat organization can’t be maintained efficiently, when roles and priorities are so loosely defined and everyone is included in everything. Learn to trust your lead people, and make that trust proliferate downward/sideways, etc. Let people specialize and not have to cover every issue that comes up, and you’ll gain efficiencies & experts.","1) Cool mission, cool product, great halo reputation: Seems like a great place to be!

Curve ball changes and poor management.,2015-07-16,Owner Advisor,"Canoga Park, CA",-1,0,-1,Tesla Motors truly has an excellent product and a grand mission to solve the world's problems. CEO/founder Elon Musk is an inspiration and leader for our generation and these are reasons why I wanted to start a career with Tesla and why I stuck around so long. A game changing and innovative company.,"With new companies come growing pains and in my case the sales department. At my particular location I experienced a lot of disappointment in company decisions and who they allow to call the shots. After being hired as an owner advisor (sales person) I got a substantial salary pay cut after only two weeks. I was told to ""roll with the punches"" and ""aren't I lucky to be part of this great mission and the Tesla team?"" I continued the job but not without notifying HR that it seemed extremely misleading and unfair considering I had turned down other job offers to work at Tesla with the initial income we agreed upon in mind. They reminded me that they can change how much they pay their employees, that changes could be made whenever they want, as often as they want and there's nothing I can do about it. The general public seems to think that the sales staff is commission based or receives a large percentage of commission per car and this is not true. Unlike car dealerships, the sales staff is either hourly or salary with a lousy fluctuating commission of under $100 per car (average Model S sells for about 110k). That being said, the overall pay is nowhere near what people think. Tesla tends to hire a young staff and seeks ""energetic and innovative talent"" but this could be because no seasoned professional would tolerate drastic company-wide policy changes and what goes on behind the scenes. I left a career at Tesla Motors because I could not tolerate my manager's behavior one moment longer. I contacted HR multiple times because he had created such a hostile work environment. Every co-worker I had at the time and every single one after me has contacted HR about this man. Every single one. He's a huge liability to the company and yet miraculously still has the same job, having only been given light warnings for his actions. Early on while I was still training he cursed me out in front of customers and my new coworkers. He wanted me to follow around one of the sales members like a puppy, not leaving their side and when I went across the room to get something he used profanities at me because I disobeyed his orders and wasn't following their every shadow. He told me to pretend like I have a rope tied to my waist and my co-workers waist. This was in front of my new colleagues and a customer he was talking to. It was humiliating and demeaning. I would soon come to find that this guy lives for drama. He tries to play the employees against each other by stirring up rumors and gossip and creating jealousy by giving sales-orders (and with it commission) to whomever he likes most that week. He curses at employees, yells and points in their faces, makes employees come into work on days off and makes them do excessive work from home during time off. So much verbal abuse, harassment, drama, ego-trips, power-trips, and aggression. It often left the staff shaking, crying or just quitting all together. I was eventually offered a promotion and graciously accepted. I'd be transferring to the delivery department and would finally get away from this guy. Weeks turned into months before I went to job shadow. It was 5 months later before they were ready for me but it wasn't at the location I had been promised and training at rather an hour and a half away. I declined because I did not want a 3 hour daily commute and was always told I'd be working at the place 20 minutes from my house. When I declined they tried putting me on a guilt trip saying, ""it's a shame you'd pass up such an amazing opportunity because of your car. And we were going to offer you ___(an amount lower than my sales salary)"". In short, it was never a promotion, just a way to incise me to work there. Some say delivery is worse than sales. A guy I know who works there is sometimes required to work seven days a week during every end of the quarter. Seven! How is this legally possible? For the 60-70 hour work weeks he put in (I am not exaggerating here) his salary divided into hourly didn't fall below minimum wage so it was legal even though he was working around the clock, making minimum wage with no overtime compensation. Once the realization hit that there was no place better to transfer to (unless I wanted to relocate to headquarters in Palo Alto) I knew my days with Tesla were officially numbered. The last straw came when my manger came into work on his day off for the sole purpose of yelling at me because he didn't like the way I worded an email. Worst work experience of my life. So bittersweet because everyone who finds out I worked for Tesla praises the car, the company and knows me to be passionate for the cause (I drive an EV and still preach Tesla). But if they know me well enough, they've heard the stories of a company that's still working out the kinks and a sales manager who is so absurdly inappropriate and out of line.","Listen to feedback from former and current employees.

They reminded me that they can change how much they pay their employees, that changes could be made whenever they want, as often as they want and there's nothing I can do about it. The general public seems to think that the sales staff is commission based or receives a large percentage of commission per car and this is not true. Unlike car dealerships, the sales staff is either hourly or salary with a lousy fluctuating commission of under $100 per car (average Model S sells for about 110k). That being said, the overall pay is nowhere near what people think. Tesla tends to hire a young staff and seeks ""energetic and innovative talent"" but this could be because no seasoned professional would tolerate drastic company-wide policy changes and what goes on behind the scenes. I left a career at Tesla Motors because I could not tolerate my manager's behavior one moment longer. I contacted HR multiple times because he had created such a hostile work environment. Every co-worker I had at the time and every single one after me has contacted HR about this man. Every single one. He's a huge liability to the company and yet miraculously still has the same job, having only been given light warnings for his actions. Early on while I was still training he cursed me out in front of customers and my new coworkers. He wanted me to follow around one of the sales members like a puppy, not leaving their side and when I went across the room to get something he used profanities at me because I disobeyed his orders and wasn't following their every shadow. He told me to pretend like I have a rope tied to my waist and my co-workers waist. This was in front of my new colleagues and a customer he was talking to. It was humiliating and demeaning. I would soon come to find that this guy lives for drama. He tries to play the employees against each other by stirring up rumors and gossip and creating jealousy by giving sales-orders (and with it commission) to whomever he likes most that week. He curses at employees, yells and points in their faces, makes employees come into work on days off and makes them do excessive work from home during time off. So much verbal abuse, harassment, drama, ego-trips, power-trips, and aggression. It often left the staff shaking, crying or just quitting all together. I was eventually offered a promotion and graciously accepted. I'd be transferring to the delivery department and would finally get away from this guy. Weeks turned into months before I went to job shadow. It was 5 months later before they were ready for me but it wasn't at the location I had been promised and training at rather an hour and a half away. I declined because I did not want a 3 hour daily commute and was always told I'd be working at the place 20 minutes from my house. When I declined they tried putting me on a guilt trip saying, ""it's a shame you'd pass up such an amazing opportunity because of your car. And we were going to offer you ___(an amount lower than my sales salary)"". In short, it was never a promotion, just a way to incise me to work there. Some say delivery is worse than sales. A guy I know who works there is sometimes required to work seven days a week during every end of the quarter. Seven! How is this legally possible? For the 60-70 hour work weeks he put in (I am not exaggerating here) his salary divided into hourly didn't fall below minimum wage so it was legal even though he was working around the clock, making minimum wage with no overtime compensation. Once the realization hit that there was no place better to transfer to (unless I wanted to relocate to headquarters in Palo Alto) I knew my days with Tesla were officially numbered. The last straw came when my manger came into work on his day off for the sole purpose of yelling at me because he didn't like the way I worded an email. Worst work experience of my life. So bittersweet because everyone who finds out I worked for Tesla praises the car, the company and knows me to be passionate for the cause (I drive an EV and still preach Tesla). But if they know me well enough, they've heard the stories of a company that's still working out the kinks and a sales manager who is so absurdly inappropriate and out of line.",0.25,0.84

Healthcare benefits are decent, but that's essentially where the pros to working for Tesla come to an end.","The short version:
1.) Horrible, unqualified management, 2.) low pay, extreme hours and high demand, 3.) zero support and poor communication. 

The long version:
Management, particularly on the sales side of the organization, is a major failure. Starting from the top down, the initiative for the past couple years has been to bring in people from the fashion or ""high end retail"" industries who have ZERO knowledge of the product, the company culture, the automotive industry, and no desire to actually learn about it. These people are given management positions without proper training or education, and lack even minimal base knowledge to do their jobs well so instead they rely on statistics/metrics in hopes that they can succeed by playing a numbers game. They do not have good intentions for the company or it's long-term success, and have completely destroyed what was once a great culture and environment to be a part of. People who have worked for the company for years and dedicated themselves to the mission aren't given any consideration, and very few promotions from within ever occur anymore. There is rampant sexism and favoritism at almost every level, if you have any aspirations to advance in your career, it won't happen here. 

The pay is awful, you will be expected to work a minimum of 60-70 hours a week, available 7 days a week, for a 40hr/week salary. Commission for sales is insulting (approximately one-thousandth of a percent of the cost of the vehicle), you don't get paid until the car is delivered (which, as a member of the sales team, you have ZERO control over and can take 8+ weeks in some cases), and you get to work in an environment where your employment is constantly being threatened by your boss(es). 

HR doesn't do anything to correct any issues brought to their attention, they do not look out for the interest of the employees in any way, shape, or form. Emails and phone calls to just about any department often go ignored on a consistent basis, and regardless of how valid it may be, no one at any level of management wants to hear about the problems that exist and how to fix them. If you speak up, you will most certainly have a target on your back and I guarantee you will be subject to retaliation at some point or another. It is abundantly clear that the employees who are down in the trenches, bending over backwards to try and achieve targets and satisfy customers are thought of as completely expendable. Meanwhile, those who act with no regard for ethical behavior and professional courtesy are often the ones to benefit from promotions, it is truly disturbing.","Get rid of almost all management currently in place on the sales side of the organization. They do not have the best interest of Tesla at heart, and they operate in an unethical and immoral manner that would never be tolerated at any other company of this calibre. Put the ego aside and actually listen to your employees when they tell you the problems that exist and make an effort to resolve them.","The Model S is a fun vehicle to drive due to the instant torque, and one of the perks is that you'll obviously drive the vehicles from time to time.

Every vehicle sold is one less gas polluting vehicle on the road. All the employees come from various backgrounds, and generally well rounded very smart individuals. 
-Strong health insurance with min cost out of pocket
-Providing a amazing experience to individuals who understand the vision of the company. 
-Driving around to various events or smaller marketing events in a 100K+ vehicle 
-Sharing a common enthusiasm to get people to buy a all electric vehicle 
-Very forward thinking with big technology advancements 
-Working for Elon Musk and wanting to change the world
-Seeing potential customers and soon to be owners light up with complete joy with they finally get it. 
-Operations & logistics to really learn the process of the automobile being built to when a customer takes delivery of their vehicle to join the Tesla movement. 
-Casual work environment. (Usually black, or gray pants with a pressed white shirt).
-Watching news releases from Tesla HQ, and Elon Musk has you filled with joy for the day
-Knowing that you are making a difference to the world and to families providing them with different lifestyle. 
-Potential equity grants within the company","Compared to similar roles within the auto sector, the pay is on the low side
-Micromanagement of daily reports to direct managers, when they have the same access to the salesforce reports
-Test Drives with individuals who don't care about anybody on the road but themselves. 
-The car is one of the safest vehicles ever built/created but you sometimes fear for you life when test drivers either freak out on the Auto Pilot, the aggressive speeding, and drivers who don't really know how to properly and use two feel to drive. 
-Retail hours are horrible if you are in the retail channel. If you have a family with children, it's almost near impossible to have a constant schedule each week. 
-Small office that hosts 10 people at any given time. Approx 100 sq/ft no windows, people eating over top of each other, and silly shenanigans that they young staff partake in. 
-Very childish behavior from both staff and management. When you are trying to get people on the phone, you will notice that management will be playing childish games on their cell phones. 
-Majority of the people including management don't drive a Tesla themselves. (Either they can't afford the car, or they are not sold on the product enough to drive & own one). 
-Changing compensation plan 3 times in a 5 month period
-No real training with the actual system and process. You are thrown into the system and need to learn the process other wise you get talked down to and treated much like a second class citizen. 
-Product knowledge changes daily
-Defending negative press news regarding a sensitive material around the Auto Pilot technology
-Very Cliquey environment. If you come from the outside without starting out either in Delivery, washing cars or Customer Service Expert you will have limited support for you to be successful. 
-Leads from internet that are ready to buy are generally passed along to the top performers, leaving the bottom performers to fend for yourself. 
-Working Holidays & long weekends missing time from family and other events or functions that you care about. 
-No real team approach to want to help one another (back to cliquey). Very cut throat mentality and only care about themselves. 
-Reps will snake deals right from you that you have spent hours with from other locations. (Very similar to working at a traditional dealership, and they go to your competitor but worst feeling because it's with the same DIRECT company. 
-Working the floor to ""FishBowl"" for leads. Clearly there are times individuals are not in the market, can't afford the car, or are ready to have a potential test drive. Management doesn't care and wants more leads. Doesn't matter if they are garbage or Hot leads they just want another phone number or email to add their hundreds of thousands of contacts that they already have in their ever growing data base. 
-Regional management lives in a Ivory tower and has never walked the talk. Some with huge egos that typically enjoy talking down to staff with nonsense stories that have no relation to the current role within Tesla. 
-Unrealistic goals that are almost stretch goals and unattainable even for the top performers
-Malls are going to be distressed assets in the near future. The footprint of malls are shrinking with more and more stores closing, resulting in a fewer foot traffic. 
-Being told that cold calls are not allowed, and only reaching out to those who have raised their hand for additional information. 
-Marketing yourself through social media is very restricted and don't want images, or videos to be portrayed in the wrong light. 
-Management across the board in multiple departments with no real life experiences
-No discount on the purchase of a their vehicles, only on lease programs which if you live in state that offers state incentives they would waive the sales tax which there is no savings. 
-Dress code from HQ doesn't match to what is actually expected in each store. 
-No 401k match","For individuals who want to make a major career change, spend more time on training the software and the platform. Take a few steps back and develop the knowledge with the software that would reduce errors and mistakes from the sales team. 

Don't kick people when they are down. Sales is a roller coaster ride, with ups and downs. When someone has great potential spend the time with them to provide positive feedback to have them learn from their mistakes to move forward to get better. 

Stop pushing the CES team to be bullies on the floor to have unqualified prospects provide their information to have Owner Advisors (Sales Reps) pound them with unwanted phone calls and emails. 

Hiring managers should stop over stating and hyper inflating the possible orders that are coming in to prospective new hires. Was there for 5 months and nobody on the team hit any of the numbers that said they were hitting. Very misleading. 

Provide compensation for the Model 3 and don't do what was done on the X and the S by not offering payouts when it was first released. With over a half million reservations and when more and more sales reps (owner advisors) find out that they will not be compensated, could cause a mass exodus. 

Start getting service right. Many owners from the early 12' or 13' first generation model S are looking to upgrade to AP 2 have expressed concern that they love the car, but hate the service process. Cars are washed but leaving service centers ""dirty"" water marks, cars not being pulled around for the owner. 

When vehicles enter service, it could be days to months for the repair giving owners a older car with limited capabilities and really a much lower version of their current vehicles. The loaners should be almost the same for them and not be put into a car with AP1 RWD when they have purchased AP2 w / Dual drive system.","You have the ability to be part of something truly amazing with Electric Vehicles. Every vehicle sold is one less gas polluting vehicle on the road. All the employees come from various backgrounds, and generally well rounded very smart individuals. 
-Strong health insurance with min cost out of pocket
-Providing a amazing experience to individuals who understand the vision of the company. 
-Driving around to various events or smaller marketing events in a 100K+ vehicle 
-Sharing a common enthusiasm to get people to buy a all electric vehicle 
-Very forward thinking with big technology advancements 
-Working for Elon Musk and wanting to change the world
-Seeing potential customers and soon to be owners light up with complete joy with they finally get it. 
-Operations & logistics to really learn the process of the automobile being built to when a customer takes delivery of their vehicle to join the Tesla movement. 
-Casual work environment. (Usually black, or gray pants with a pressed white shirt).
-Watching news releases from Tesla HQ, and Elon Musk has you filled with joy for the day
-Knowing that you are making a difference to the world and to families providing them with different lifestyle. 
-Potential equity grants within the companyCompared to similar roles within the auto sector, the pay is on the low side
-Micromanagement of daily reports to direct managers, when they have the same access to the salesforce reports
-Test Drives with individuals who don't care about anybody on the road but themselves. 
-The car is one of the safest vehicles ever built/created but you sometimes fear for you life when test drivers either freak out on the Auto Pilot, the aggressive speeding, and drivers who don't really know how to properly and use two feel to drive. 
-Retail hours are horrible if you are in the retail channel. If you have a family with children, it's almost near impossible to have a constant schedule each week. 
-Small office that hosts 10 people at any given time. Approx 100 sq/ft no windows, people eating over top of each other, and silly shenanigans that they young staff partake in. 
-Very childish behavior from both staff and management. When you are trying to get people on the phone, you will notice that management will be playing childish games on their cell phones. 
-Majority of the people including management don't drive a Tesla themselves. (Either they can't afford the car, or they are not sold on the product enough to drive & own one). 
-Changing compensation plan 3 times in a 5 month period
-No real training with the actual system and process. You are thrown into the system and need to learn the process other wise you get talked down to and treated much like a second class citizen. 
-Product knowledge changes daily
-Defending negative press news regarding a sensitive material around the Auto Pilot technology
-Very Cliquey environment. If you come from the outside without starting out either in Delivery, washing cars or Customer Service Expert you will have limited support for you to be successful. 
-Leads from internet that are ready to buy are generally passed along to the top performers, leaving the bottom performers to fend for yourself. 
-Working Holidays & long weekends missing time from family and other events or functions that you care about. 
-No real team approach to want to help one another (back to cliquey). Very cut throat mentality and only care about themselves. 
-Reps will snake deals right from you that you have spent hours with from other locations. (Very similar to working at a traditional dealership, and they go to your competitor but worst feeling because it's with the same DIRECT company. 
-Working the floor to ""FishBowl"" for leads. Clearly there are times individuals are not in the market, can't afford the car, or are ready to have a potential test drive. Management doesn't care and wants more leads. Doesn't matter if they are garbage or Hot leads they just want another phone number or email to add their hundreds of thousands of contacts that they already have in their ever growing data base. 
-Regional management lives in a Ivory tower and has never walked the talk. Some with huge egos that typically enjoy talking down to staff with nonsense stories that have no relation to the current role within Tesla. 
-Unrealistic goals that are almost stretch goals and unattainable even for the top performers
-Malls are going to be distressed assets in the near future. The footprint of malls are shrinking with more and more stores closing, resulting in a fewer foot traffic. 
-Being told that cold calls are not allowed, and only reaching out to those who have raised their hand for additional information. 
-Marketing yourself through social media is very restricted and don't want images, or videos to be portrayed in the wrong light. 
-Management across the board in multiple departments with no real life experiences
-No discount on the purchase of a their vehicles, only on lease programs which if you live in state that offers state incentives they would waive the sales tax which there is no savings. 
-Dress code from HQ doesn't match to what is actually expected in each store. 
-No 401k match",0.0,-0.53

As a result, everyone learns from one another. Also, if you are a full time employee, Tesla's health benefits are amazing.","If you are thinking about working in the showroom at Tesla Motors, you must understand that the cons will outweigh the pros, majority of the time. It's exciting to be a part of Tesla Motors at first, because who doesn't want to work for Tesla Motors right? 

There are many cons to consider when working in the sales/retail line of Tesla Motors. This isn't just my perspective, simply Google Tesla Motor's employee retention rate and let the numbers speak for itself. First of, there is zero work life balance. Part time employees work 35-40 hours a week without health benefits. Time slots between October-December Floating Time Off and Paid Time off are blocked off, causing additional stress for employees who have families from out of the states/country, or want to utilize their Floating Time Off before it restarts at the beginning of the year. 

Some managers are hired from the retail industry without any expertise in car sales which causes the team to sink because their answer to every team member's question is ""I don't know."" Not only do they not know the answer to a problem, they also fail to obtain additional phone/email contacts of skilled professionals who can help answer difficult leasing and financing questions for their team. Long story short, there is no leadership and guidance. In other words, employees are not equipped with the right tools to set them up for success, even if they take it upon themselves to learn from outside sources. 

Lastly, if you've been at Tesla Motors for a while (1+ year), you'll start noticing that rarely, does anyone get promoted from within. I've seen many people who were ""promised"" a promotion for their hard work and seniority within the company, but sadly, every single hire for that same non-entry level position would get hired from outside. The most mind blowing aspect of HR and upper management recruitment is the fact that the new hires for the non-entry level automotive sales position fail to posses ANY prior automotive experience, neither do they have expertise on how Model S or Model X functions.

The ignorant public respects you because you work for Tesla.","1.) 0 Work life balance. This isn’t a choice either. Unqualified managers that could barely make it as a Wal-Mart greeter tell you what to do. You better do it because if you don’t, you don’t care about your job. The managers will tell you that you have to work 10 hour days in a Home Depot until you meet their goals. This can take a day or two (if you’re a lying scumbag) or it could take a a solid week. You better hit their arbitrary goals or you’re a terrible employee. 
2.) False promises. You will be promised $400k a year. What that means is you’re actually going to make $30k year. If you want $70k a year, you better be willing to work 90 hours a week. In Tesla’s eyes, you work for what you bring home. So forget your home life, do the work they demand and you’ll be rich. Not true. You might bring home $70k for devoting your life to a bunch of Solarcity managers that barely made it out of high school but were strong at deceiving people in door to door sales. Imagine that, a door to door sales guy that mislead you? Well, he’s your boss. So...if you want $400k a year, you better get your lying game on. Haha...actually, $400k will never happen.

3.) Carrots. Not the sweet ones that are oh so delicious. You will get carrots dangled in front of you about your potential and how great you are. What they are doing is making you feel good about your background and how you’ll be awesome at Tesla. What really happens is they don’t care. The carrots are there to make you feel good about making ~$5 an hour only to be criticized because you couldn’t make someone commit to a $50k solar install the first time you met with them. Nine times out of 10, if one makes a commitment on the first visit...they decide to cancel. Tesla holds you accountable if your customers don’t commit on the first visit. 
4.) Forced to break the law: Tesla encourages their employees to get a customer signature on a legally binding document. What the customer doesn’t know is there is a box where the document is supposed to be notarized. Tesla encourages their employees to forge those legal documents and not tell the customer it should be notarized. They do this by hiring notaries and having one or two per team to back door the notary.","If Elon knew how the solar side of Tesla was run, he would do some work out here. The fact of he matter is if you want to work here, ask how long your hiring manager has been there. If they say they were here since Solarcity, run!!!!! If they are new Tesla employees, ask how long their manager has been here. BTW, HR supports the managers and has no interest in being neutral. I’m pretty sure Tesla qualified their HR reps by their allegiance to Solarcity management or employees. These HR reps are never on your side. THEY WILL ALWAYS GET MANAGEMENTS SIDE.

Enjoy the location as well.","The management at Tesla is a mess. - All the managers want us to look like the best, aka they want to manipulate the numbers. So it doesn’t matter what ACTUALLY happens to a customer, just make sure you call enough people in a day. 

No improvement - Management and neighboring departments ask what they can improve, when agents respond and actually give examples in which such changes would apply, the answers are always “No” and/or “that doesn’t make sense” - which only shows the disconnect from all departments. No one listens to anyone. How are we supposed to work together when we can’t even get along ourselves?

You’re punished for wanting more - You can’t simply ask for improvements, and/or FIGHT for what a customer needs (not even above and beyond, literally requesting the minimum requirements in order for a solar project to go forward.) is a battle EVERYTIME. You have to almost harass to the point of exhaustion. 

Over worked - I can list off every department that is insanely understaffed, but to be transparent I’ll list examples in which we’re severely lacking:
 - It is taking 3+ months to get a piece of paper from another department (inspections) to move a customers account. It has literally been stuck. I have looped in my, and their management countless times, in person and email without any response or a sign of help or concern. 
 - The utility relations team has dropped the ball so many times its expected. It’s an entry job with little to no training, they never submit applications correct or complete, and when you call them out or tell them so they can resubmit soon (Because by this point the application has already been submitted 8weeks) they usually bark at you and tell you not to contact them directly - but rather to email their queue team that 1) Doesn’t exist anymore 2) They are not the agents who submit anyways, they do not know how to correct applications. When they attempt it’s just rubbing salt in the wound.

There is no sense of urgency - Management says this all the time, but trust me they’re so disconnected they couldn’t even tell you how to do the job you’re working under for. They ask you call as many people you can in a day and send as many emails as you can but the second you find a flaw on a project they blame you and tell you to figure it out. There are countless times I’ve had to loop in 10-20 people on an issue and panic everyday for a week for someone to understand there is a need higher than what u can provide. Customer experience is ruined because no one cares. The application teams are infamous for playing golf in the middle of the office, while they’re taking 7-9 business days to acknowledge and email you sent requesting they correct the applications that they submitted incorrectly

You’re constantly in negative and upsetting settings - Management holds weekly meetings and all they do for 30 mins is give the third degree on how dissatisfied they are and how awful you and your team are, while reminding you, you are only showing other people why we do not need to exist. Don’t worry though, when we ask management to allow the improvements to do better they simply say “Figure that out yourself” and/or “No.” And laugh. Not only that, Sales Support Specialists are held to a much more burning quality standard than anyone else AKA when the application team takes 4 weeks to notice a rejection (that I do not have access to.) because they’re playing golf, I will be the agent to be yelled at not only by the sales rep and the customer, but by management because I must be stupid to if not known.

No one will tell you how to improve but they all remind you you suck. - they have a spreadsheet that talks about your reviews, standard “Red, yellow, green.” Ranking. They almost always give you red and yellow and will never tell you why. Myself and multiple agents have asked for more information and more insight in this grading and they just don’t give it to us. Good old “yeah soon.”.. “soon” has been months. But they continue to mark good jobs as red, reminding you you suck, but uh.. offer no help to improve.

This is the most backwards and negative place I’ve ever been. Everyday is tough and I am happy to be leaving. The solar side will not survive long.

Elon always sends emails about his precious cars.. what about those PWs Elon? We’re delayed months runining people’s credit because you’re in no rush to deliver the product they purchased.",Be replaced. You’re all tainted.,"Innovative, green company. Enjoy the location as well.The management at Tesla is a mess. - All the managers want us to look like the best, aka they want to manipulate the numbers. So it doesn’t matter what ACTUALLY happens to a customer, just make sure you call enough people in a day. 

No improvement - Management and neighboring departments ask what they can improve, when agents respond and actually give examples in which such changes would apply, the answers are always “No” and/or “that doesn’t make sense” - which only shows the disconnect from all departments. No one listens to anyone. How are we supposed to work together when we can’t even get along ourselves?

You’re punished for wanting more - You can’t simply ask for improvements, and/or FIGHT for what a customer needs (not even above and beyond, literally requesting the minimum requirements in order for a solar project to go forward.) is a battle EVERYTIME. You have to almost harass to the point of exhaustion. 

Over worked - I can list off every department that is insanely understaffed, but to be transparent I’ll list examples in which we’re severely lacking:
 - It is taking 3+ months to get a piece of paper from another department (inspections) to move a customers account. It has literally been stuck. I have looped in my, and their management countless times, in person and email without any response or a sign of help or concern. 
 - The utility relations team has dropped the ball so many times its expected. It’s an entry job with little to no training, they never submit applications correct or complete, and when you call them out or tell them so they can resubmit soon (Because by this point the application has already been submitted 8weeks) they usually bark at you and tell you not to contact them directly - but rather to email their queue team that 1) Doesn’t exist anymore 2) They are not the agents who submit anyways, they do not know how to correct applications. When they attempt it’s just rubbing salt in the wound.

There is no sense of urgency - Management says this all the time, but trust me they’re so disconnected they couldn’t even tell you how to do the job you’re working under for. They ask you call as many people you can in a day and send as many emails as you can but the second you find a flaw on a project they blame you and tell you to figure it out. There are countless times I’ve had to loop in 10-20 people on an issue and panic everyday for a week for someone to understand there is a need higher than what u can provide. Customer experience is ruined because no one cares. The application teams are infamous for playing golf in the middle of the office, while they’re taking 7-9 business days to acknowledge and email you sent requesting they correct the applications that they submitted incorrectly

You’re constantly in negative and upsetting settings - Management holds weekly meetings and all they do for 30 mins is give the third degree on how dissatisfied they are and how awful you and your team are, while reminding you, you are only showing other people why we do not need to exist. Don’t worry though, when we ask management to allow the improvements to do better they simply say “Figure that out yourself” and/or “No.” And laugh. Not only that, Sales Support Specialists are held to a much more burning quality standard than anyone else AKA when the application team takes 4 weeks to notice a rejection (that I do not have access to.) because they’re playing golf, I will be the agent to be yelled at not only by the sales rep and the customer, but by management because I must be stupid to if not known.

No one will tell you how to improve but they all remind you you suck. - they have a spreadsheet that talks about your reviews, standard “Red, yellow, green.” Ranking. They almost always give you red and yellow and will never tell you why. Myself and multiple agents have asked for more information and more insight in this grading and they just don’t give it to us. Good old “yeah soon.”.. “soon” has been months. But they continue to mark good jobs as red, reminding you you suck, but uh.. offer no help to improve.

This is the most backwards and negative place I’ve ever been. Everyday is tough and I am happy to be leaving. The solar side will not survive long.

Largely due the severe incompetence of local market management who were far more concerned with achieving personal accolades and working themselves up the corp hierarchy from stealing the credit of their teams' extreme efforts. There is a quarterly vehicle supply cycle that demands every 3rd month you nearly have kill yourself with required hours, there is a zero regard for your work/life balance, so everything else in your life suffers as you work 10+ hrs/day for weeks on end with no days off. The company provided so little of what was required regarding people and resources and demanded you make do with so little, it's no wonder this resulted in a downright embarrassing customer experience that you then were the personal face of. The delivery facilities we worked out of and where customers took possession of the new very expensive electric vehicles were an absolute joke that never improved, and fit and finish quality of the vehicles themselves which is widespread known as awful took all the pride out of working for the brand. Our job was largely to mask/cover these up to deliver the max number of units as possible, it was a dishonest ugly practice. If I could sum up in one word what Tesla lacks and is reason for this scathing review, it's simply: integrity 

In addition, they were completely dishonest with staff during the beginning of covid regarding the potential risks to their health, and it's no surprise to hear of the disgusting racist hateful culture that exists in Fremont. It's a toxic corporate culture that only getting worse with its rapid growth. Their apparent solution, move to Texas where it's easier to continue there with their terrible ways.

The days that Tesla can leverage their early monopoly in EV's is coming to the an end, and their competition stealing all their best talent (at time I left about only 1/5th remained on my team from when I started) for obvious reasons like Rivian and Lucid is going to eat their lunch with a far superior quality product and a worthy customer experience for the high amount of money they demand.

Ultimately, I sincerely hope they improve or more so completely turn it around, as most important is the adoption of electric transport to make a meaningful impact on climate change. I however don't see any change happening but worsening as the company culture/attitude is a trickle down of Emperor Elon's, and all/any executive and management efforts is simply to appease him.","Hire a COO who is a passionate human-first executive and give them all the empowerment (from ego maniac Elon) to make meaningful change to the work culture, staff work/life balance.

- Very little compensation for working hard and exceeding targets. Approx. $35 if you sell a $200,000 car. Salary was about $52,000 per year. So it's okay but there's also an expectation that you'll work outside of hours. I saw some employee's working 80+ hour weeks. 
- Very little progression. New positions often given to new hires vs people who have been there for years and proved themselves 
- Extremely high employee turnover. Low income + high expectations + poor management meant people quickly became dissatisfied and unhappy. In addition, company restructures and cost cutting meant collections of people were being fired every 6 months. 
- Managers and HR very inexperienced which leads to frustrated teams, a lack of employee support and toxic work environments. 
- Often felt like a popularity contest. Poorly performing employee's often promoted because they were likeable and ""funny"". 
- Cold calling and cold selling was a huge part of the role.

It's a very scrappy environment, and the right fit will find this satisfying but even those who are fully behind the mission can feel a little burnt out after a while. To mass produce vehicles, Tesla is quickly transitioning from start up to mature company and there is delay in getting systems and processes in place to become a well established business (onboarding experience, training, etc. needs some work.) Pay and benefits aren't competitive with market, but again, if you're money driven go to a dealership or to a consulting firm or a bank. Passion for the mission is critical.",0.0,1.0

1. My Manager spends a lot of time with me and my colleagues and gives me feedback on my performance. I feel that he wants me to succeed and become better
2. I have seen several people get promoted to higher roles. This is making me feel good about my own chances to see my hard work pays off in the future

But the worst part of the job for me was - constant let down of customer expectations:
- most sales advisers (at least in our store) are so arrogant they really don't give the customer the respect or time they deserve,
- test drive bookings - being cancelled right left and centre,
- when the customer comes for the appointment it is often made wait for ages before it is actually taking out for a drive
- trade in quotes are not being submitted

No employee discounts on any of the vehicles even though profit for vehicle is rumoured to be around the 40%+ mark
Not much room for advancement for non-management staff as employees are often kept in their roles to serve the manager's/ company's purpose
It is difficult to recruit new talent, because of the work conditions, pay and terrible leadership most informed job seekers do not want to work there
Employee turn over is extremely high, 95% of the employees in Canada have been there for less than 6 months. 
Constant layoffs, these seem to happen every quarter
Management does not get overtime pay and can work 75-90 hours a week or more
Meetings are often scheduled last minute and after hours with no consideration for the time differences across the country
As this is like a retail operation open 7 days a week and late hours, you also get calls and emails 7 days a week and late hours and are expected to respond. 
You work 7 days a week one way or the other 
Management is in several meetings a day

Summary: It truly is not a good place to work. I caution both the inexperienced and the experienced because you will be taken advantaged of if you're young and disgusted if you're experienced.","I don't believe that any advice to management would be implemented. 
This is difficult because Elon Musk is immature, erratic and doesn't care about his employees. They are not building leaders or strong staff with their unreasonable work hours, targets and requests. They are overworking and breaking down great people and thus losing their best people. 

Family is important, outside activities are important for any person's happiness. You cannot truly be happy if all you do is work.

It starts from the head down so change in an organization like this will be very difficult unless Elon steps back and puts someone else in place to change the culture.

I don't believe that Tesla will be willing to implement any type of work/life balance as this would mean that people would work regular hours and there would perhaps be a decline in productivity. 

Maturity, Integrity, Trustworthiness and leadership skills are required to be a good leader and unfortunately Tesla hires leaders that can run reports not those that can manage people.

My advice, if anyone is listening... Care for your staff, let them have a life. Treat them like human beings and not like the machines that you have at the Factory. This is really the main thing that is missing. Everything else you can work around, but feeling unappreciated, used and constantly being asked to give more and more without receiving any thanks or appreciation in return is unacceptable.","The idea of working for the company is exciting.
